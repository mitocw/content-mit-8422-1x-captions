Any questions?
[INAUDIBLE]
Again with the dt, I'm just curious.
We take a very short but why don't we run into something
like the quantum Zeno effect, where
if every evolution is initially quadratic
like for [INAUDIBLE] frequency.
You take very short dt's, certain measuring system,
shouldn't for a choice of sufficiently short dt,
the simulation would give you strange results
because of some sort of quantum Zeno effect?

That's a very deep question [INAUDIBLE]
and I want to think about it more
but I think I've excluded that by saying that the timestep
dt is larger than the correlation
time of the environment.
So I'm doing some kind of mock up approximation
of the environment.
Whereas, the quadratic part of the behavior
is a coherent time evolution.
For very short timesteps a wave function evolves quadratically.
But this part is a coherent evolution,
and that's related to the fact that an atom can emit a photon
but in the very first moment, before the vacuum has
transported it away, it can take the photon back.
And the result of that is that at very short times
the exponential decay doesn't start,
or exponentially it starts out a little bit flatter.
We get the exponential decay, we get Fermi's golden rule,
and we get optical Bloch equations
only if you're timestep is larger than the correlation
time of the reservoir.
And the fact, you'll remember when we derived the master
equation, we had to say we do a step which
is sufficiently small for the dynamics of the atomic system
but sufficiently large that we are not getting into any memory
effects of the reservoir.
And we've done the same assumption here.

Other questions?
Nicky.
In this [INAUDIBLE] wave I would say,
the environment measures the system
at regular time intervals delta t, which
are large compared to the correlation time
but smaller [INAUDIBLE] evolution of the atom.
But now everyone, isn't that affected
the Markov approximation [INAUDIBLE]
derived the master equation?
Yes.
And I was just wondering, if we just [INAUDIBLE]
derived by making the master equation.
Maybe we don't actually need the idea of constantly measuring.
Maybe a physical interpretation of the Markov approximation.
Oh yes, exactly Nicky.
I think you said it really very, very nicely.
We derived a master equation just
by assuming that the system takes a photon,
and past the correlation time the photon
is taken for good by the environment.
And with a Markov approximation we formalized that.
There is no memory effect, the photon is not stored,
like in a cavity.
The photon has disappeared.
And by saying that this time is very short,
this was a Markov approximation and the derivation
of the master equation.
But that also means if the photon has disappeared,
has separated from the atomic system,
we are now free to make a measurement.
And of course, it shouldn't matter whether we
make the measurement or not.
But what I was able to do today is
I was making now the assumption, let's assume
that we make a measurement.
We measure all of the photons which have been emitted
and the measurement is probabilistic.
And we fold this probabilistic evolution
into our quantum system.
And what we obtained was exactly the same time evolution
for the density matrix as we got from the master equation.
So in other words, this should tell you
that interactions with an open quantum system,
where irreversibly, energy, photons, angular momentum,
or whatever flows into the environment.
Once it has flown into the environment you can measure it,
and you get all the stochastics from the measurement.
But even if you don't measure it you
get exactly the same stochastics as if you had measured it.
It's all the same.
Jenny.
Now that I think about it, it seems sort of weird to me
that we're making these measurements or lack
of measurements, these interactions
at regular intervals and not--
It doesn't really matter.
All we have to make is, we could actually
make delta t a random variable.
It wouldn't change anything.
The only thing we have to make sure
is we have to make the time interval short enough that we
don't have maybe two photons emitted in that time.
We just want to make sure that it's
a simple probabilistic branching, yes or no.
And that's the only requirement here.

This is a problem based on that.
Would you say that would be the wave function evolved
and then collapse?
And this is where the emission comes in.
To now say the equivalent wave function
evolved and then collapsed when you make a measurement, to say
that [INAUDIBLE] evolves.
So is it possible to also evolves some kind of formalism?
Like this rather than the [INAUDIBLE] operator?
Because here, like even though the density matrix's operator
but it's kind of like--
it should describe the state.

I haven't seen it Marc but I'm absolutely certain that you
could describe the same physics in the Heisenberg picture,
where the time evolution is with operators.
Because what we have here is we have a timestep delta t
where the system evolves as an isolated quantum system.
And then we measure again.
And so, I think if you would use operator equation you would
have an evolution of the operator
with the same Hamiltonian, which is
known as Hermitian Hamiltonian.
And then the measurement would do some form of projection.
I have to think about what the protection would
be in terms of operators but my gut feeling
is you can always take the transformation where
you put the time dependence into the operators
and not into the wave function.
On the other hand, I have some little bit misgivings
about that because the quantum Monte-Carlo wave function
was really developed in order not to deal with matrices,
not to deal with something which has dimension n times n, if n
is the number of components of the wave function.
It was specifically formulated to have
the simpler description with n coefficients for the wave
function.
But conceptually, I think it is evolution
with a Hamiltonian measurement, evolution with a Hamiltonian
measurement.
And I assume this could also be done with operators.
Nancy.
[INAUDIBLE] but when the measurements are actually
done how important is the randomness?
After epsilon that there [INAUDIBLE] random numbers.

Well, I think how random a random number
has to be is really dealt with in computer science
and mathematics.
But [INAUDIBLE] you always get this exponential behavior.

I don't know the answer.
I mean here, conceptually, it should
be a completely random number.
And I think there are algorithms which
produce pseudo random numbers.
But if the pseudo is close enough,
if there is a recurrence time of your number.
if your series of random number repeats itself
after several billion random numbers
this gives you a small error bar.
And
If you'd only do a limited sampling, a limited
number of time trajectories, I don't think it matters.
Of course, if you want to have ultimate precision then also
the precision of the random number
may enter through the back door at some point.
[INAUDIBLE] of the photons.
But if you know the photon is communicating
and we have this information, then we
can decide which is the [INAUDIBLE]
That's correct.
If we would know--

If we would know more about the environment,
if we would say we measure the photons in a certain basis,
or when energy is dumped in the environment
by a dephasing mechanism, we look at the environment.
Then of course, we would add extra information to it.
And then certain quantum trajectories
would reflect the extra knowledge we have.
And of course, we would then describe everything
in this basis.
On the other hand, what you should
learn from this is once the information, once the photon
has escaped, it doesn't matter for the time evolution
of your atomic system in which basis you measure the photon.
So the evolution of the atomic system itself,
at least when you average, is unaffected by this basis.
However, if you make a coincidence measurement,
that you see your atoms which has emitted
is still flying through your vacuum chamber.
And now you figure out the photon
is emitted as circularly polarized light.
Then of course, you know that this atom, which is still
available, has emitted circularly polarized light,
and then you have actually obtained extra information
about your atom.
In other words, the photon and the atom
was entangled, like a Bell pair.
And if you now do a measurement on one part of the Bell pair
you know more about the other part.
But this is just how quantum physics works.
If you don't use this information for anything then
you could have as well not measured the polarization.
And it would have no effect on the atomic density matrix.

OK.
