I mentioned this dispersion relation.
These are sort of quasi-particles.
And I, at least, showed you how you
can measure the slope of the quasi-particle dispersion
relation by propagating sound waves,
but let me now tell you how we can
observe quasi-particles elementary excitations
directly.
And this is actually simply done by light scattering.
If you scatter a photon and the scattered photon
loses energy, H by nu.
And it is scattered at an angle, therefore
it transfers momentum, Q. This process
can only happen if there is an elementarily excitation
with momentum, Q. And energy, H nu, So in other words,
on a photon basis, you can say, photon by photon,
if you scatter a photon, the photon transfers
momentum and energy.
The process can only happen if you can form a quasi-particle
with this momentum and energy.
So since this is sort of the direct way of making out
whether the system has the possibility to absorb momentum,
Q, and energy H nu.
This has, sort of, a name.
This-- the scattering probability
is called the dynamic structure factor.
And the dynamic structure factor is just an integral
over all the possibilities that a many-body system can
absorb momentum and energy.
Now, there is one nice feature which
was introduced by us at MIT and that
is if you happen to mention the dynamic structure factor
often you do it with neutron scattering.
You scatter neutrons or x-rays and they scatter spontaneously
at an angle.
And you need a detector to detect the scattered particles.
But in our case, because the gas is so dilute,
the distance between atoms is on the order
of the optical wavelengths.
We don't want neutrons.
We don't want x-rays.
We want photons, because the wavelengths of photons
is perfectly matched to the properties,
to momentum transfer and such we need for our system.
But photons, we have photon lasers.
So instead of, in a painstaking way, analyzing the frequency
and the momentum of scattered photons,
we don't do this spontaneous scattering process,
we do a stimulated process.
We use two laser beams.
And we stimulate a photon to be scattered into the other laser
beam.
And by having the two laser beams at frequency difference
delta-omega, we are really asking the system,
are you ready to absorb delta-omega energy.
If yes, then you have a quasi-particle.
So this is how we do quasi-particle spectroscopy.
And a few years later, this method
was defined by the Weitzman Institute.
And what you see here is they vary
the angles between the laser beams,
realize different momentum transfer,
and what you see is the low dispersion,
the linear dispersion relation for low momenta,
and then the quadratic part at high momenta.
So this is called Spec spectroscopy.
It's a variant, you can see, of Raman spectroscopy.
Where you go from zero quasi-particle state
to one quasi-particle state through unstimulated Raman
forces.
