I've so far dealt with aspects of a homogeneous Bose-Einstein
condensate where, of course if you are a homogeneous system,
you formulate everything in momentum space.
But now we want to deal with the situation
that our condensates are finite in size.
And in addition, they are usually
in harmonic oscillator potential and therefore their densities
inhomogeneous.
Let me start the discussion with the inhomogeneous Bose-Einstein
condensate by showing again the picture which brings
in some memories of 1996.
It was the first time that we could
see the Bose-Einstein condensate in the trap.
Before, people have just seen it by time of light
when it was pretty much already destroyed,
or it was just flying out.
But here, we see the trap Bose-Einstein condensate,
and we could even take multiple pictures
of the same condensate.
So you can see, this was the first time
that a condensate was seen alive.
What you see here is actually the bimodal distribution.
You see the condensate, and due to speckle pattern,
the thermal cloud looks like fragmented,
but this is just a speckle pattern due to the signature
noise.
But here you really see now, not in ballistic expansion
as I've shown you on Monday, but really in situ the size
and shape of the condensate.
OK, how do we describe it?
Well, the message is pretty much exactly the same way
as we did with the Bogoliubov approximation and such,
but instead of in momentum space,
we do it now in position space.
Actually, I have to say this week,
I go through a lot of material, but what
I'm trying is to give you sort of a spirited and animated
overview that you really know what is important,
where is the same concept appearing again
in a different way.
The details, I've posted actually the original articles,
references, some high school notes,
some of them written by myself on the website.
So yes, it's a little bit different character
than other lectures.
I want to show you a lot of things
and put a special emphasis on the ideas.
OK, so in second quantization we are now
using field operators, which create
and annihilate particles at position r.
This is sort of the single particle
Hamiltonian, kinetic energy, and potential energy.
And our interaction term has now again four operators--
two annihilation operators, two creation operators--
but they are now formulated in position space.
We do exactly the same as we did in the homogeneous gas.
We assume the potential is short range, that
means delta function.
And that means we can get rid of one of the integrations in r
and r prime.
But we still have product of four operators.
We can formally solve this the equation by writing down
Heisenberg's equation of motion for those field operators,
but of course this cannot be solved.
Remember, products of for operators are hard.
We have to reduce it to two operators.
And this is actually done by the Bogoliubov approximation again,
but it's done here in the following way.
Remember, in momentum space we replaced a naught and a naught
[INAUDIBLE] by the square of a naught.
What we do here it is we say, this
is sort of a [? quantum ?] field.
And when we have a superfluid, this field operator
has an average value it's actually
the microscopic superfluid order parameter.
So we replace the operator by an average value,
which we assume is large because many, many particles are
in the superfluid state.
And then we have fluctuations, which are small.
And what we will do is-- well it's pretty clear--
when it comes to the fluctuations,
we will neglect higher products, products of four fluctuation
operators, and we are down to c numbers
and, as you will see, two operators.

We can-- and this is even more dramatic,
it wouldn't make sense for the momentum space,
but it does make sense in precision space--
we can even do our first approximation
where we completely neglect those fluctuations.
And then what we have is when we simply insert a c number into--
let me just go back-- into this Hamiltonian,
we have then an equation for this number,
for this function psi
And this is the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation,
or it's also called Gross-Pitaevskiit equation,
which is now an analogy to Schrodinger's equation,
but now for the microscopic wave function, which is occupied
by many, many particles.
And in addition to the kinetic energy
and the prepping potential, the external potential,
it has a term, which is proportioned to the density.
And this is just a mean field repulsion,
which one atom feels exerted by the other atoms.
I should say, so just to connect it
to what I've said earlier about the [? quantum ?] depletion,
you can regard the function psi as the best approximation
to an ideal that Bose-Einstein condensate.
So if you want to write your many body wave
function as a function psi to the power n,
all particles are in the same quantum state.
Then evaluation of calculation would
say that this function psi should obey these equations.
If you want to read up what I've said,
I've posted a recent paper from which I found very pedagogical,
where derive the Gross-Pitaevskiit equation
without even using an operator, psi [INAUDIBLE]
without using any second quantization.
They just say, we have an Hamiltonian for an interacting
system, and we try to write the complicated many body wave
function as a wave function to the power n.
And then you put this [INAUDIBLE]
into your Hamiltonian, and do a variational optimization,
which single particle wave function
psi, if taken to the power n, minimizes
the total energy of n particles, including interactions.
And the answer is this equation.
So there are many ways.
This equation creation it's sort of very natural.

Now you all know about single particle physics,
kinetic energy and an external potential.
Let's not learn what this density dependent term does.
Well, it's pretty clear.
There is a price to be paid for density.
And well, the total integrated density
is, of course, given by the total number of particles.
That means if you lower the density somewhere,
you've to increase the density.
But because this is not a non-linear term,
if you have an average density, and you lower it
here and increase it here, you have actually more repulsive
energy than if the density is flat.
So this term has only one goal.
