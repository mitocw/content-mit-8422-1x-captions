Let me start now with Bose gases I've taught about this subject
several times at summer schools, and what I give you here
is a compressed version on it.
I will not talk too much about the ideal Bose gas
because most of you have seen that in statistical mechanics.
And I will also omit superfluid hydrodynamics,
because well, it's interesting, but it's more
special than the other topics.
So what I want to cover here is to give you
the main ingredients for the description
of weakly interacting homogeneous and inhomogeneous
Bose gases.
And then, at the second part, talk
about the superfluid-to-Mott insulator transition.
But well, for those of you who are not
working with [INAUDIBLE] Bose gases, maybe some of it
sounds like jargon to you, but there
is one sort of overarching concept
which I want to emphasize in the theoretical description.
And this is some form of mean field approximation.
When we go through the weakly interacting Bose gas,
then we go to superfluid thermic gases,
and we discuss the superfluid-to-Mott to insulator
transition, one theme will be, if you have a product of four
operators-- and that's what you get when you're interacting
atoms--
you cannot solve anything.
And you need a method to go from the product of four operators
to the product of two operators, and then
you solve a quadratic equation.
And the step to go from four to two
is called a mean field approximation.
And I want to show you three kinds of mean field
approximations.
For the one you have often seen for the weakly interacting
Bose-Einstein condensate, but then I
want to show you a mean field approximation for fermions,
where it is a pairing field which is the mean field, not
your usual mean field energy.
And then I want to talk about--
before that even, I want to talk about the superfluid-to-Mott
insulator transition where we do a very different mean field
approximation.
So maybe you will realize a little bit
by repeating the scheme how theory is done,
and how you can deal with simple Hamiltonians.
But you can solve them, because they contain
products of four operators.
So there is sort of a thread through those three chapters
in showing you how you can do interesting many body
physics by doing the right approximation.
It also sort of teaches you how many body physics
is done you haven't Hamiltonian, which you can solve,
and you have to guess the solution and put half of it
in an approximation.
And once you've done the right approximation
the rest becomes solvable.
So with that spirit, I want to go with you today
through the [INAUDIBLE] of approximation for weakly
interacting Bose gases.
OK, I don't think have to say too much
about the ideal Bose-Einstein condensate,
because it's dealt in pretty much all undergraduate
or graduate textbooks.
There are just two things to remember in terms of a system
description.
First whether Bose-Einstein condensation occurs or not
depends on the density of states,
and that depends on dimension and confinement.
So the fact that you are in a trap,
it changes the density of states and it changes the criteria
for Bose-Einstein condensation.
But then, in terms of a system description,
if you want to describe your Bose gas and its properties,
there are aspects of Bose-Einstein condensation
which are pretty close to the ideal gas,
and others which require many body physics.
What is always close to the ideal gas
is the transition temperature and the condensate fraction.
Because what happens is, in almost all experiments,
when you reach Bose-Einstein condensation,
your gas is, to a good approximation,
non-interacting because kt, the transition temperature,
is much larger than the interaction energy in the gas.
So before condensation, or at the onset of condensation,
your gas is like an ideal gas.
And you only find a few percent corrections
to the formulae for the ideal gas.
So therefore, if you want to know
what temperature do you reach the transition point,
or if you are below the transition point--
if you're 50% below the transition temperature, what
is your condensate fraction-- you
can simply look up the original formula by Einstein,
and it gives you a reasonably accurate answer.

However for the condensed gas, for the fraction
of atoms which are Bose condensed,
those are atoms in [INAUDIBLE] state,
for them there is no other scale than the energy
between the atoms.
So therefore, for the uncondensed gas,
you can get away with an ideal gas approximation
for the condensate itself [INAUDIBLE]
to put in the many body physics of the interaction.
Well, this slide shows here shadow images
of expanding Bose-Einstein condensate.
We do have episodes of cooling in a magnetic trap.
You see sort of the shadow picture of the thermal cloud.
And you see sort of the onset of Bose-Einstein condensation
as the sudden appearance of what looks like a pit in a cherry.
There is a cooled and more confined
distribution of atoms in the Bose condensed state.
So this gas is pretty much described by an ideal gas--
well, you can put in the G2 function
at the onset of cranium degeneracy--
but it looks almost like an ideal gas,
whereas in an ideal gas the Bose-Einstein condensate
should be in the lowest energy state of the trap.
And I will show you in the next few minutes on Wednesday
that we are far away from that.
So interactions are negligible for the normal component,
for the thermal cloud, but are very important for the Bose
condensed gas.
So when you take a cross-sections
through this cloud of 2D pictures,
you see how that broad thermal distribution
turns into a Bose-Einstein condensate.
And if you look at such a profile,
you can clearly see the normal component,
the normal component can be, with good accuracy,
be fitted by a non-interacting model,
whereas the central peak, this is Bose-Einstein condensate
which requires the description I want to show now.
The condensate fraction is shown here,
and again with fairly good accuracy,
it follows the description of Einstein,
because the condensate fraction is not
a property of the condensate, 1 minus the condensate fraction
is a property of the thermal gas.
In the spirit of Einstein, Einstein
calculated how many atoms can be in the thermal component
at a given temperature.
So Einstein called it the settle weighted gas.
At a given temperature you can only
keep in thermal equilibrium a certain number
of atoms in your gas.
If you have more atoms, they condense into the calm state.
This is sort of the statistical description.
So therefore what I'm plotting here as the condensate fraction
is actually the property of the normal gas.
It shows that the normal gas as situated
can only hold a certain number of atoms,
and the remainder of the number of atoms
