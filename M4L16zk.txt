Now, when we describe an atom in the laser field, and the atom
scatters light.
Or we have a laser beam--
and I have to tell you, when we have a laser beam,
we don't provide exactly N atom and N photons.
The laser beam is in a coherent state,
and they are Poissonian fluctuations.
But now we do the next approximation.
Namely, we say when N is large and delta N can be neglected
with regard to N, then, at least for the range
of important photon numbers for the problem,
this coupling becomes independent of N.
We simply take the average number of photons in our laser
beam, and define an electric field which
is independent of N. The product with a dipole operator
of the atom, that's what we call the Rabi frequency.
At that point, we introduce a classical electric field
through this definition, and therefore the dressed atom
picture--
also, we started with the fully quantized Hamiltonian--
is now identical to a classical field with this electric field
amplitude.
What we have gained is, we could discuss everything
in a time independent picture.

I promised you, we go back to two
by two matrix, which we have seen many times.
It's a two level system.
We have the detuning.
We are in the rotating frame, so that means the ground
and the excited state with N and N minus 1 photons,
have the same energy.
But if you have a detuning, there
is a difference whether we excite the atom
or whether we put a photon in the laser field.
You have seen that many, many times.
The coupling is now described by the Rabi frequency.
That's our typical two-level system
where the two levels, if they're in the rotating frame,
everything is time independent.
The two levels are split, and they are coupled.
How many times have you seen the solution of a two
