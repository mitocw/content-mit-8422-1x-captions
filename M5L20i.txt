All this is theory, but it has been experimentally observed.
If you want to pair fermions, we just need two states.
At MIT we use mainly lithium-6.
Lithium-6 has many hyperfine states,
but we just use the two lowest ones
in a high magnetic field where we have a Feshbach resonance.
We pair the particles-- well, we need a little bit lasers
and equipment.
And then we observe pair condensates.
They look exactly like atomic condensates
but there are pairs inside.
That there are really pairs inside we found out
with rf-spectroscopy.
And eventually, when we rotate [INAUDIBLE], we find vortices,
and you know already vortices are the smoking
gun of superfluidity.
With that, I've rushed you through an important
and very elegant chapter of physics: the BEC-BCS crossover.
Let me just end with an outlook that I've
talked about: a basic phenomenon in bosons and fermions,
both centered about superfluidity,
because I think it was pedagogical to show
you the differences and the similarities.
But we can now regard those ultracold bosons and fermions
as building block of quantum simulators.
Building blocks to understand, in its simplest manifestation,
interesting physics.
You can see the Bose gases are a quantum simulator
for superfluid helium.
The Fermi gases are a quantum simulator for superconductors.
We briefly talked about optic lattices,
which can be regarded as a quantum simulator
for crystalline materials.
But there is much more you can do with those building blocks.
