Today is actually a very nice topic.
I think almost every lecture we have a nice topic,
but today is especially nice.
It's called unraveling open quantum system.
That may not tell you so much, but unraveling
means we want to sort of untangle it,
we want to understand what is inside.
And so we want to develop a better understanding of what
is inside a density matrix.
How can we think about the quantum system
in an even more microscopic way than the density
matrix tells us?
And again this finds applications in atomic physics
because one application of it is spontaneous emission
[INAUDIBLE] equations.
On the other hand, actually, this class
will also teach you something very general
about quantum physics.

So today's lecture, this part, will have three topics.
One is, I want to provide a motivation for single quantum
systems.
And you should appreciate this.
A single quantum system is not what Schrodinger and Heisenberg
taught us about.
Quantum mechanics was formulated as an ensemble average.
But today we want to talk about, is there something in addition
about single quantum systems?
Part two is-- addresses the derivation of the quantum Monte
Carlo wave function method.
And this is a formalism which is really
simulating, in quite general terms, quantum physics
by following, using quantum Monte Carlo
simulations, trajectories of individual quantum systems.
So here, the individual quantum system,
even if you don't have one, becomes a computation tool.
And eventually, in part two, I want
to give you another example for unraveling open quantum
system, which are different models for the phasing.
And if you remember that this was on one of your homework
assignment, that's correct, I sort of
want to, here, take your homework into the class room
discussion.
Well, I think it's nice to start this lecture with a quote
by Erwin Schrodinger.
He said, we never experiment with just one electron
or atom or molecule.
In thought experiments, we sometimes assume that we do;
this inevitably entails ridiculous consequences.
Well today we want to talk about those ridiculous consequences,
because many people in our field trap,
address, and observe single electrons and single atoms.
Now this is related to quantum jumps.
Quantum jumps has even made it into the popular realm.
You can find lots and lots of references on quantum jumping,
but I warn you, this is about quantum
jumping into different worlds.
It's about broadening your horizon.
And those authors, those people, actually,
sell you something by claiming that people like Einstein
and Stephen Hawking would support the idea that you can
jump into a different universe, experience
another version of yourself--
probably a better version of yourself--
and this will inspire you to change your life in the world
you live.
But so, this is quantum jumping.
I'm not talking about quantum jumping,
I will only talk about quantum jumps.
So what you see here is really a classic experiment,
one of three experiments which were
done almost simultaneously.
There have always been races for the first observation
of something, and there was the Hamburg group by Toschek,
the Seattle group by Hans Dehmelt,
and the Boulder group by Dave Wineland, who
observed the phenomenon of quantum jumps
for the first time.
Let me just tell you what it is because that's exactly what you
want to describe.
Here in the situation, you have a system.
It's a trapped barium ion with a p and s state.
And there is a very fast transition,
where you can rapidly scatter light and get
lots of fluorescence at 493 nanometer.
But what happened is, every once in a while,
the particle has a branching ratio to decay, to d state.
And well, d to s--
two units of angular momentum--
the transition here, down to the ground state is very slow.
It's slow because it's forbidden,
it's even slower because it happens at longer wave
lengths of 1600 nanometer.
And this is slow and it has a lifetime of about 50 seconds.

So if you think about it naively,
and that's probably the correct approach, you would say,
the particles in the s state, it's
like a light bulb it scatters many, many photons.
But then it branches to the d state, and for 50 seconds,
the light bulb is switched off until the particles
spontaneously go down to the s state,
and then the light bulb is switched on.
And this is exactly what people observed.
But I mean-- I was-- this was '86.
That was the time I was at graduate school,
and I talked to theorists in the field.
And a respectable theorists told me
that there was a controversy--
probably not among experimentalists,
who use a naive approach, but theorists, who believe too
much in what they calculate--
because if you solve it quantum mechanically, and look,
what would you get?
It's a steady state solution, [INAUDIBLE] in steady state,
leaves in a steady state, and if you calculate
the quantum mechanical expectation value,
the expectation value is constant as a function of time.
So a simple quantum calculation would say the fluorescence is,
on average--
well just the time average.
It is constant and is time independent.
So there were some serious doubts
whether you would observe this or something which looks
more like he ensemble average.
Well-- made all the theorists realize you cannot calculate
the steady state average, you have to calculate
the correlation function in steady state.
And the steady state correlation function
has structure exactly 50 seconds.
So in a steady state system if you're
interested in fluctuations in temporal behavior,
you can't just calculate quantities,
you have to calculate correlation functions
of quantities.
So anyway, but, then of course, if you now
average over many, many realizations,
you'll find exactly an exponential decay
with 50 seconds.
And this is sort of what you would
get from an ensemble average.
So this is what quantum jumps are.
This is what you should always imagine
when we talk about quantum jumps in the rest of this lecture.
But I also want to show you a more recent example
from Serge Haroche's school, in Paris,
where they observed quantum jumps recording
a single photon in a cavity.
So what happens is there's a signal photon in this cavity.
And they can read out whether there is a photon
or not, by sending [INAUDIBLE] atoms through.
And the single photon is never absorbed,
but it causes a phase shift, an [? AC-stark ?] shift
on the [INAUDIBLE] atom, and then they can read out with
a [INAUDIBLE], the AC-stark shift.
So every atom which passes through the cavity
will tell you whether there is a photon or not.

And this is shown here.
Blue means there is no photon, red means it is a photon.
So here, you repeatedly figure out, again, there is no photon,
and suddenly there is a quantum jump
when the cavity has absorbed the photon
or when a thermal photon was released.
You may say, what happened here?
Well, no measurement is perfect, there is some noise.
But by seeing that these are outliers,
you clearly see that here is a photon in the cavity.
And here, where the red read out of the atom
overwhelms the blue read out--
here you have no photon.
And then, as time goes by, you can
observe [INAUDIBLE] death and birth of micro cavity photons.
So these are now quantum jumps in the--
not in atomic population, but quantum jumps in the photon
number in the cavity.

Is the time scale on that?
Yeah, time is second.
So what is show here is--

300 milliseconds and this is 2.5 second.
[INAUDIBLE]
What does the density of the lines mean?
Each line is a [INAUDIBLE] atom, which
has been read out with a [INAUDIBLE] and,
Does that mean [INAUDIBLE]
I think that means there was a [INAUDIBLE] atom in state e,
which means there is a photon and blue means--
the blue bar means there was a [INAUDIBLE] atom in state g.
These are two highlighting states of the rubillium atom.
Each spike here is one read out of the microchannel plate.
So these-- are detector clicks, you can see, yes--
you can say blue is yes and red is no,
and these are the two clicks.
Yeah, but the separation between two clicks is not uniform
No, because if you have an atomic beam,
the atoms come not equally spaced out.
There's a randomness when the atom comes,
I think it's Poissonian statistics in this experiment.
It's a real experiment, it's amazing.
Other questions, [? Timore? ?]
Just one more question so the-- for example,
the first bit of blue is all the measurements for the same state
of the cavity.
I don't know if blue means photon or no photon,
but if it does mean photon that means
it's the same photon interacting with--
Yes.
OK.
Yes because-- this is something people know--
that the photon number in this cavity only changes
over very long time scales.
And you sort of see--
exactly here-- how--
you see here two quantum jumps, one from blue to red and one
from red to blue in this cavity.
Yes?
I don't know if this maybe just my eye sight's not very good.
But in the bottom left graph, or on the bottom graph
in sort of the left corner, it looks
like there was some overlap between the dark blue
and the dark red.
Yeah
You mean here?
Yeah right there-- is that--
there is a photon and not a photon?
[INAUDIBLE]
I think, to the best of my knowledge--
I'm really look--
I've heard wonderful talks about it
and you can go back and read the paper.
But this probably means in the atom number in the cavity,
and the algorithm they have used to analyze the data
says that here, the photon number was 0, it jumped to one,
and jump back again.
So if you see here, for instance,
there is some overlap, but you would still
say, since either there is a photon or not a photon,
as long as you have an--
if you have a higher number of red clicks than blue clicks,
you would say there is a photon.
And the little overlap, there is maybe a little bit of time
where you don't know whether there is a photon or not.
But this is real because every measurement
takes a certain amount of time.
Since you have a few random clicks,
if there are a few random clicks,
you do not know yet if the system has jumped.
You have to wait a little bit.
But this is really also showing how
our knowledge about the quantum system comes with time.
And therefore the wave function of this statistical operator
changes with time, because wave function, statistical operator,
are simply a description of our knowledge about the quantum
system.
[INAUDIBLE]
You could have a situation, for instance, you
could prepare the cavity that it has an equal probability for 0
and one, and then what you would read out
may just be completely random.
So that may be possible, but in that experiment, I think,
the nature here is that you have,
most of the time, 0 photons, because the cavity is cooled
to very low temperature, and only occasionally does
the thermal distribution, the [INAUDIBLE]
distribution of photons in the cavity have a one.
And what we observe are the thermal fluctuations
between mainly 0, and occasionally a one.

If you would make the cavity a little bit hotter,
it would have, maybe, half of the time a one,
and half of the time a 0.
But that wouldn't mean that you have completely randomness
in your results, because there is a thermal relaxation
time over which a photon is created,
and the photon goes back.
The photon would not jump back and forth from the cavity
to the walls of the cavity in microseconds.
It would probably have an exchange time
and you could measure the thermal correlation
time of photons in a cavity.

It's a really good experiment.

OK, so in that sense, I think I showed you
that what Schrodinger said is ridiculous, is real,
is the subject of current research.
And since [INAUDIBLE] information processing,
quantum computers, we need single quantum system
