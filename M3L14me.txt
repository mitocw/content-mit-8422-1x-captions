Now, let's do Cavity QED.
And there are lots of experiments
going on in the research group of Professor Vuletic.
And in this situation, our system is actually not
just the atoms, it's the atoms and a single mode
of the cavity.
This is our system, and the environment
are all other modes.
So in other words, the atoms interacting with a single mode
of the cavity--
this is our system--
and the environment is now accessed
by emitting the atom is emitting.
Or there are photons leaking out of the cavity,
because the cavity mirrors do not have 100.0% reflectivity.
I will immediately reduce it to one Lindblad operator,
but we could now say that this system in its full glory
has four different Lindblad operators which
provide dissipation, which provide coupling
to the environment.
The first one is simply what we had before--
spontaneous emission.
However, if we allow that the environment is thermal,
we have to multiply.
But whenever you have emission, and you have already
population in a mode, and it's a number of thermal photons
in every mode on average, then you
have an extra bosonic or photonic stimulation term.
That's sort of stimulated emission,
but not by the laser beam.
It's now stimulated emission by a thermal occupation
of all the other modes.
So just assume for that purpose that you have a cavity here,
but the cavity is now in a black body cavity, and everything--
all modes--
in the vacuum are no longer vacuum modes.
They are occupied within thermal photons.
Of course, if this is the case, we
have also the opposite effect, you can see by [INAUDIBLE].
Namely, that we can have an absorption process.
We absorb a photon from the thermal background.
But now we have two more processes,
and this is photons leaking out of the cavity.
When the photon leaks out of the cavity, this leakage
is not coupled to the atom, it's coupled to the mode.
We describe the mode by a mode operator a.
So now the leakage out with the [INAUDIBLE]
is presented by that.
But in the case of thermal photons,
we have stimulation by the thermal photons.
And also, if we have thermal photons,
photons can not only leak out of the cavity,
they can also leak into the cavity.
So we have assumed here that we have
n thermal photons in each mode of the environment.
So in other words, if you want to look at, for instance,
Serge Haroche's experiment in the wonderful experiments
in the microwave domain, he has cavities at, I think,
gigahertz frequencies.
And even at cryogenic temperature,
there are occasional thermal photons in this mode.
But you are now expert enough that you
would know how to set up a master
