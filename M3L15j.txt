I think it's pretty clear that with this approach,
you can deal with a great variety of situations.
Let me just mention two obvious extensions.
One is polarization.
A photon is detected.
That means your random number produced a number epsilon,
which was smaller than delta p.
At that point, you can create a second random number, which
determines if the photon has been detected with signal
plus, sigma minus, or pi polarization,
or you can discuss recoil.

If the photon is detected, you use
you throw on another random function generator, which
determines what the character of the photon
is, so what direction [INAUDIBLE]
the photon has taken.
And this determines now what is the recoil, the change
in momentum of your atom.
So you see you can start with an atom at 0 momentum.
You can see it emits a photon.
And then your computer always makes a choice
based on the random number.
And then you say, OK, my photon has now received a recoil kick
at 45 degrees.
Now your wave function of the photon is such and such.
And if you add a laser to the Hamiltonian,
the recoil may have kicked, may have
Doppler shifted the resonance.
But everything is easily taken into account.
So you see that this Quantum Monte-Carlo Wave Function
method can easily be extended to describe
external degrees of freedom, multiples layers of fields,
and all that.
