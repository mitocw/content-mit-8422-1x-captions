And now we are ready to put everything together.
So we want to know the force.
The force using Heisenberg's equation
of motion for the momentum derivative
is the expectation value of the operator,
which is the gradient of the Hamiltonian.
OK, so now we have to take the gradient of the Hamiltonian.

This is the only expression actually today.
I would have liked to just write it down and build it
up piece by piece.
But let me step you through.
We want to take the gradient.

The dipole operator of the atom does not have an R dependence.
It's just it's on the atom, wherever it is.
But the gradient with respect to the center of mass position
from the atoms, comes from the operator
of the electromagnetic field.
So in other words, what this involves
is the gradient of the operator of the fully quantized
electromagnetic field.
But we have already written that the electromagnetic field
is an external electromagnetic field.
Classical electromagnetic field plus a vacuum fluctuations.
But the vacuum fluctuations are symmetric.
There is nothing which tells vacuum fluctuations
what is left and what is right.
So therefore, the derivative only
acts on the classical electromagnetic field.
So this is how we have now, you know,
we first threw out the coherent state.
And now we throw out the vacuum state.
And therefore, it is only the classical part
of the electromagnetic field which
is responsible for the forces.

Now we make one more assumption which greatly simplifies that.
R is the center of mass position of the atom.
And we have to take the electromagnetic field
as the center of mass position.
And if the atom is localized, wave
packet with a longer [INAUDIBLE] wave.
We sort of have to involve the atomic wave function
when we evaluate this operator of the electromagnetic field.
However, if the atom is very well localized,
you would actually want the atom to be localized to
within an optical wavelength.
Then under those circumstances, you
can replace the parameter R, which
is the position of the atom, by the center of the atomic wave
packet.
So therefore, the kind of wave nature of the atoms which
means the atom is smeared out.
As long as this wave packet is small
compared to the wavelengths, you can just
evaluate the electromagnetic field
at the center of the wave packet.
This assumption requires, since the scale
of the electromagnetic field is set by the wavelengths.
This requires that the atom is better,
it's localized better than an optical wavelengths.
And that would mean that the energy
of the atom or the temperature has to be larger
than the recall limit.
And if your localized then to within a wavelength,
your momentum spread is larger than Heisenberg's uncertainty
relation [? in h bar ?] k.
And that means your energy is larger than or equal energy.
So if you want to talk-- if you want to go to the low--
if you want to have a description of light forces
at that limit, you may have to revise this point.
But for most of laser cooling, when you start with a hot cloud
and cool it down to microkelvin temperatures,
this is very [INAUDIBLE].
Collin?
The electric field doesn't contribute in the sense
of the expectation value?
The zero?
But wouldn't the rms value be non-zero?
So what's the--
Exactly.
I mean in the end, you will see that in a moment.
When we talk about cooling limits,
fluctuations spontaneous emission provides heating.
It doesn't contribute if you want to find the expectation
value for the force.
The vacuum and the fluctuations--
I mean that's also logical.
The vacuum has only fluctuations,
it has no net force.
But the fluctuations heat, and for heating it
will be very important.

But we come to that a little bit later.
So what if the light is squeezed, if you [INAUDIBLE]?

If the light is squeezed, yes.
That's a whole different thing.
We really assumed here that the light is in a coherent state.
Now--
The approximation that we had, that
will remain an approximate state, right?
[INAUDIBLE]

Well, you know, if you--
this can crease a vacuum.
And then it's creased.
But there's often photons you can't really
laser cool with it.
So the only way you could possibly laser cool
is if you take this creased vacuum and displace it.
So now you have instead of a little circle
which is coherent state, you have
an ellipse which is displaced.
I haven't done the math.
Maybe that would be an excellent homework
assignment for the next time I teach the course.
You could probably show that the displacement operator, which
is now displacing this creased vacuum,
again can be transformed into a c number.
And the ellipse, this creased vacuum fluctuation--
an ellipse has an even symmetry, has 180 degree rotation
symmetry.
And I could imagine that it would not contribute.
Again, it would not contribute with a force.
So in other words, if you have a displaced creased vacuum,
my gut feeling is nothing will change here.
But what will change are the fluctuations
which would possibly change the heating.

OK, so within those approximations,
Heisenberg's equation of motion for the force
becomes an equation for the acceleration
for the atomic wave packet.
And it involves, now, two terms.
One is the atomic dipole moment as
obtained from the Optical Bloch Equations.
And the other one is nothing else
than the gradient of the classical part
of the electromagnetic field.
And with that, we are pretty much at the equations which
you looked at in your homework assignment, which
was a classical model for the light force.
Because this part is completely classical.
And the only quantum aspect which we still have
is that we evaluate the dipole moment not necessarily as just
a driven harmonic oscillator.
When we take the optical block equations,
we will also find saturation.
A two level system can be saturated.
Whereas an harmonic oscillator can never be saturated.
Let me just repeat.
So this is completely classical except for the expectation
value for the dipole moment.
But for low excitation, of course,
and we've discussed it many, many times.
A two level system is nothing else
for weak excitation than a weakly excited harmonic
oscillator.
Leader So then we are completely classical.
But we want to discuss also saturation and then [INAUDIBLE]
the optical Bloch equations, of course, come in really handy.

Next approximation.
We want to now approximate the dipole moment, the expectation
value of the dipole moment with the steady state solution.

The steady state solution, an analytic expression,
we just plug it in and we can have wonderful discussion
about light forces.
The question is are we allowed to do that?
Now I hope you will remember that's actually one reason why
I did that when we discussed the master equation
and we discussed an atom in a cavity.
I introduced to you the adiabatic elimination
of variables.
We adiabatically eliminated all diagonal matrix elements.
Whenever you have something which
we'll access sufficiently fast and you are not
interested in this short time scale,
you can always say I will replace this quantity
by its steady state value.
Steady state with regard to this slowly changing parameter.
And we'll want to do exactly the same here.
So let me just translate.
It's the same idea, exactly the same idea.
But let me translate.
If an atom moves, we have two aspects, two timescales.
One is the motion of the atom.
The atom may change its velocity.
The atom may move from an area of strong electric field
to an area of weak electric field.
But this is really all that is related to the motion,
to the change of momentum of a heavy object.
But now inside the atoms, you have,
you play with the block vector, excited state.
You put-- if the electric field is higher,
you have a larger population in the excited
state than in the ground state.
But this usually adjusts on the--
this adjusts with a damping time of gamma
with the spontaneous emission rate.
That's usually very fast.
So you can make the assumption, when an atom moves
with changing electric field, at every point
in the electric field, it very, very quickly, the dipole moment
assumes the steady state solution
for the local electric field.
And this would now be called an adiabatic elimination
of the dynamics of the atom.
And we simply replace the expectation value
for the dipole moment by the steady state solution
of the Optical Bloch Equations.

Well, this is of course an approximation.
And I want to take this approximation
and show you that, you know, how what simpler conclusions
we can draw from that.
But I also want you to know, I mean
this is what I focus off in this course,
to sort of think about them and get a feel where
those approximations breakdown.
So this approximation requires that the internal motion,
you know, two level physics, that the internal density
matrix, it has a relaxation rate of gamma.
Whereas the external motion, we will actually
see that very soon when we talk about molasses and damping,
has a characteristic damping time.
Has a damping-- has a damping time, which
is one over the recall energy.
The recall energy involves the mass.
The heavier the object, this is the weight.
So the damping time, it has all the write scaling.
And you will actually see later today
that we can actually obtain this as a time scale
over which atomic motion is changing.

So is that approximation, this hierarchy of time scales,
is it usually fulfilled?
It is fulfilled in almost all the atoms you are working on.
For instance, in sodium, the ratio of those two time scales
is 400.
But if you push it, you will find examples like helium
in the triplet statement, a stable helium
in the triple state, where the two time scales are comparable.
Helium is very light.
So therefore, it takes--
its light, therefore it's faster for a light atom
to change its motion by exchanging momentum
with electromagnetic field.
And at the same time, the transition in helium
is narrower and therefore slower.
So for metastable helium, the two time scales are comparable.
So if you really want to do quantitative experiments
with metastable helium, you may have to do--
you may need a more complicated theory.
But of course, if something is sort of simple in one case,
the richest situation provides another opportunity
for research.
And I know for instance, [? Helmuth Caff, ?]
a good colleague and friend of mine, he focused for a while
on studying laser cooling of metastable helium.
Because he was interested what happened
if those simple approximations don't work anymore.
Then the internal motion and the external motion
becomes sort of more entangled.
You have to treat them together.
You cannot separate them by a high degree of time scales.
