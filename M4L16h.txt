Then let's do a similar discussion
with reactive forces.
So a standing wave is parametrized here.
We only have an alpha vector, not a beta vector
now, because everything is in phase.
There is no phase phi of r.
So therefore, there is no dissipative force.
The only force is a reactive force.

Since a reactive force depends only on u,
there is no exchange of energy.
So that raises the question, what is really going on if it
is only the reactive part with u, how can the atom,
how can the motion change if it cannot exchange energy?
Well, we'll come to that in different pieces.
The one part I want to sort of discuss here
is that I want to show you that at the level of our discussion,
we can already understand that the atom is actually
doing a redistribution of energy and momentum.
Well, if I only hold onto my standing wave,
there is no energy exchange, because the atom is always
in phase with a standing wave, the atomic dipole, which
is responsible for the force.
But I can now do what everybody does in the lab.
We generate the standing wave as a superposition of two
traveling waves.
And if I have a superposition of two traveling waves,
there is a point in space where the phases of the traveling
waves are the same.
Then one phase is advanced in phase.
On the other side, one of the waves is lagging in phase.
And for pedagogical reasons, I pick the point
where the two traveling waves are 90-degree phase shifted.

Now the situation is that we have our electric field.
And what is responsible for the reactive light force
is the u part of the dipole moment of the optical Bloch
vector, which oscillates in phase.
But nobody prevents me from analyzing it with respect
to E1 and E2.
And so if I ask now--
I say I have one laser beam.
I have another laser beam.
And if you want after the laser beams have crossed,
you can put in two photodiodes, and you can not only
ask what happens to the standing wave.
You can also ask what happens to each traveling wave.
Are photons absorbed?
Or what happens?
And now what is obvious is, if you have an harmonic oscillator
and you have an oscillating dipole moment,
if the dipole moment is within 0 and 180 degrees
with a drive field, you absorb power.
If it is in the two other quadrants,
it emits or delivers power.
And now you see that we are in a situation which
I've picked here, where one traveling wave loses
energy and the other traveling wave gains energy.
And there is a classic experiment
which was done by Bill Phillips a while ago.
He had atoms in an optical lattice,
and they were sloshing.
And he could really measure that when the atoms were accelerated
this way, one of the laser beams gained power and the other one
lost power.
So while the atoms were sloshing in momentum space,
the power between the two laser beams
was distributed back and forth.
So this is the character of the dissipative force--
that it distributes momentum and energy between the two
