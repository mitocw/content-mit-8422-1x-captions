Our main topic today is to understand light forces,
in particular the stimulated force,
using the dressed atom picture.
And I hope once you understand how light forces can
be described in the dressed atom picture,
you will love the dressed atom picture,
as most atomic physicist do.
It is really the language we use, the intuition
we apply to atomic systems.
Whenever we have a laser beam which drives the atom,
it is in most situations more appropriate and better
to use dressed states as your basis states,
and not the naked, the bare states, which
are ground and excited state.
Now I know last week I quickly went through the dressed atom
picture.
Let me go through in a fly over by not
doing any of the derivation, but making a few comments here
and there.
Also, because I want that some of the results
are fresh in your head when we apply it
to mechanical forces of light.
So I told you that in dressed atom picture
we have two kinds of interactions.
The atom interacts with the vacuum
with a razor wire of empty modes or spontaneous emission.
And they also interact with the laser field.
And the new feature about the dressed atom picture
is that we first saw this exactly,
we re-diagonalize the Hamiltonian for that Hilbert
space, and then we allow spontaneous emission to happen.
Now, the derivation is pretty straightforward.
After a number of assumptions, we simply came to the 2
by 2 matrix where we have two levels of the atoms coupled
with a Rabi frequency.
I derived it here for you using the quantized electromagnetic
field, but in your homework, you do your life the same 2
by 2 matrix using a classical electromagnetic field which
drives the atoms.
And we've talked about the similarities and differences
last week.
Now, the 2 by 2 matrix is fairly trivial.
We can immediately diagonalize it.
And we find eigensolutions, which
are just sine theta, cosine theta
amplitude, linear superpositions of the naked states.
And the naked states are ground and excited states,
state A state B with n or n plus 1 photons in the laser field.

So it's simple.
It's just a 2 by 2 matrix, but the insight
we can get out of it is pretty profound and pretty subtle.
So what we first discussed is, and we really
need that to understand forces and energy conservation,
we can now look at spontaneous emission.
Spontaneous emission coupling to the empty modes of the vacuum
can only connect an excited state B with a ground state A.
And therefore, we have diachromatically
those four combinations, represented here
by those four arrows.
And if you look for the matrix element,
you collect cosine theta and sine theta factors.
And that's what we did here.
So we immediately get in the dressed atom picture
an expression which tells us what
are the matrix elements for the carrier, for the blue
and for the [INAUDIBLE] of the Mollow triplet.
But then there is something else,
and I added this to the lecture notes in green.
We can also now, if you know what the transition rates are,
we can set up rate equations and can solve them.
And once you solve a set of differential equations for rate
equations you know what the populations are.
But now today I want to tell you one more subtlety.
You know already that you cannot,
in the most general situation, formulate an equation with just
a population.
You know that we have master equation,
we have the optical Bloch equation.
This is an equation for the density matrix.
And usually we get equations where the populations
are mixed with coherences.
In other words, you cannot just say the diagonal matrix element
of the density matrix is the population,
and the change of population is what goes out of this state
and what arrives in this state.
Coherences play a role.
But, and this is what dressed atom picture does for you,
in the limit that we have a strong Rabi frequency,
and this is the limit you want to consider here,
the matrix equation decouples into an equation
for populations and an equation for coherences.
And if something decouples, that should tell you
we are on the right track.
We have the right description.
In this description things decouple, things are simpler.
And that means this description is
most appropriate for the physics we want to understand.
Or to say it more specifically, and all the details of course
are in the book "Atom Photon Interactions",
you can rewrite the optical Bloch equations
not in the bare basis, but in the dressed atom basis.
And in the dressed atom basis, you
find this wonderful separation between populations
and coherences.

So we have these simple rate equations
by setting the left hand side with 0,
we find the steady state populations.
This will be very important to understand the light forces.
But you should just remember the steady state solutions.
We know them.
They are just exactly given by this angle theta which tells us
what kind of superposition of the bare states
form the dressed states.
Remember in the case of theta equals 45 degrees
the dressed states are just symmetric and antisymmetric
superpositions of the naked states.
Now, what is also important are those rate
equations have a time constant.
The time constant is here the relaxation time
for populations.
And we know exactly what it is.
So it's a little bit more complicated to find
the equivalent equation for the coherences.
But just take my word.
The density matrix in the dressed atom basis
decouples into an equation for population which is simple.
The equation for coherences is a little bit harder derive
but looks the same.
And from this equation we have now an expression for what
is the relaxation time for coherences.
And just to show you one non-trivially example,
if you add up cosine squared plus sine squared, you get 1.
But based on what we derived, we have
to take cosine to the power 4, sine to the power 4.
And this gives us an effect of one half, which
will appear somewhere in an important place
in a few minutes.

So with that, we can now address,
we know now something about the intensities of this Mollow
triplet because the intensity is nothing else
than the population.
What is the population in the initial state times the matrix
elements squared.
But what comes out very naturally
is that we have different widths.
The features have different widths.
The side bands have a different width
from the central part of the Mollow triplet.
And well, this is now very naturally interpreted.
One has a width which is the relaxation
rate for the population.
The other one, the side bands have
a width which is the relaxation rate for the coherences.

I showed you, and this was just a reminder of a few weeks ago,
that when we looked at the linear matrix equation, which
is the optical Bloch equations, we
discussed complex eigenvalues mathematically.
And those complex eigenvalues, the imaginary part
is the side band frequency.
And the real part was the width.
What I have now is sort of, I can get everything
from the dressed atom picture.
But what I have gotten in a very natural and simple way
is this case, which is the case where the dressed atom
picture is particularly simple.
It's called a secular case where the population and coherences
decouple.
And so what I just showed you is that the population relaxation
time is gamma over 2.
This explains now why in this case,
the widths of the central feature
is one half of what it is when we're on resonance.
So everything is sort of nicely playing out here.

OK any questions about dressed level populations, rate
equations, the Mollow triplet?
Because we want to apply it now, in a few minutes,
