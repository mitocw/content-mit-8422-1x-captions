Our goal was to have an open quantum
system, which is the atomic system interacting
with the reservoir.
But the way, how we phrased the question,
we are only interested in what the atomic system does is.
We didn't do extra measurements on the environment.
The environment was just a dump for photons,
a dump for energy, a dump for whatever we assumed
in our dephasing mechanism.
So let me just take the example of putting photons
into the environment.
And this is described by a certain damping term.
But there is an ambiguity.
And this is shown here.
If we evolve the system of our atomic system,
the density matrix evolves.
But the environment also evolves.
And, for instance here, the unitary time evolution
has taken the excitation from the atom
and we have emitted a photon into the environment.
And you'll remember we got the optical block equation
by doing the partial trace here and just focusing
on the atomic part.
But no wait a moment.
If we trace out the environment we can trace it out
in a different basis set.
Remember, I showed you with the kind Quantum Monte Carlo
wave function we emit a photon.
But we can, for instance, detect the photon
in our Duncan experiment.
We can detect it with the linear polarization
or circular polarization.
If you have a situation where you have an s state which
decays to a p state, sigma plus takes
you two N equals plus one.
Sigma minus takes you to N equals minus 1.
So therefore, if a photon is emitted in your Quantum Monte
Carlo procedure, you would say now the atom
is in the plus one state or now the atom
is in the minus 1 state.
But if you detect linearly polarized light by just putting
a polarizer here-- and this is a unitary transformation in front
of your detector--
you would no longer project the atomic system on plus 1
and minus 1.
You would project it on N equals 0
or whatever is connected to the linear polarization
of the measurement.
So therefore, if you simply assume
that something has been dumped in the environment
and can be used for measurement, there
are many ways, many unitary transformations,
what you can do to the information, to the energy,
to the photons which have been dumped into the environment.
And each of them will lead to a very different trajectory
in your Quantum Monte Carlo system.
So therefore, if you just dump the photons
and not measure them, you have equal rights
to assume that your Quantum Monte Carlo wave function jumps
to states which correspond to circular bases,
or jump to states which correspond to linear basis,
and there are many, many possibilities.
But each of those possibilities is 100% correct on leveling
of the density matrix.
And if you just do it right, assume that the measurement is
done in a certain basis and you are consistent with it,
you will 100% correctly describe the time evolution
of your atomic system.
