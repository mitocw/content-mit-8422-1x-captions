Today I want to discuss with you some characteristic solutions
of the optical Bloch equations.
But before I do that, let me first discuss with you
the assumptions we made to derive a master equation.
And I hope you remember the Born approximation and the Markov
approximation.
The Born approximation says that the reservoir will never
change.
The reservoir is always, for instance, in the vacuum state.
And the Markov approximation said
that the correlations in the reservoir
are delta function related.
It can absorb photons instantaneously.
The vacuum has no memory time.
It's like a black hole.
It sucks up everything, but it's always
what it was initially, namely, the vacuum.
Do you know examples where those assumptions are not fulfilled?
I make it so natural, that these are the most
natural assumptions.
But what are the systems which cannot be described with this
approach?
So maybe an atom in a cavity, if you change a vacuum somehow?
At atom in a cavity, very good.
If an atom emits-- now, it depends.
We talked today about the master equation for photons and atoms
in a cavity.
But we will assume that the cavity is rapidly damped.
If it's a high-Q cavity, the atom emits a photon,
but the cavity has memory.
It stores the photon.
And after one period of the vacuum Rabi oscillation,
the photon goes back to the atom.
So the vacuum has memory time.
The vacuum has now a time constant,
which is the same as the time constant for the atom,
namely the period of the Rabi oscillation--
big violation of the Markov approximation.
We do not have the very short correlation
time of the system we just indicate over,
and the much longer time scale during which we
are interested in the dynamics of the system.
Maybe another example-- actually,
this example violates both the Markov approximation, also
the Born approximation, because the vacuum has
changed when it has a photon.
Do you know an example where maybe only
the Born approximation is violated?
Namely, the reservoir is changing
due to interaction with a system?

Well, we've always talked about a system and a big reservoir.
What happens when you make the reservoir smaller?

Well, then when it absorbs energy,
it will heat up and such.
It will change.
The Born approximation is actually,
when it will come to energy transfer, the assumption
that the reservoir has an infinite heat capacity.
It can just take whatever the system
wants to deliver without changing,
for instance, its temperature.
So at least you know now that there
are systems for which the treatment has
to be generalized, and you understand, maybe better,
the nature of the approximations we have made. [? Timor ?].
Well, the question, last case, which
is where the Born approximation is not violated,
but the Markov is, is there any example of that?
Well, for instance, spontaneous emission into the vacuum,
but the speed of light is so slow
that it takes forever for the photon to escape.
The Markov approximation is more about the time
scale for the system, for the reservoir, to react.
And the Born approximation is if the reservoir is really
big enough to simply absorb everything without changing.

I don't know.
You could maybe think about you have some reservoir,
but it has very bad heat conduction or something.
The transport is just very slow, and therefore, you
do not have the hierarchy of the two timescales.

Any other questions about the master equation, optical Bloch
equations?

Well, then we can learn more about
the characteristic features of the optical Bloch equations
by looking at solutions.
And I would like to discuss three aspects of solution.
I want to discuss the spectrum and the intensity of light
emitted by the atoms.
Secondly, we want to talk about transient and steady-state
solutions.
And finally, actually, I put it in the chapter of optical Bloch
equations, but I will use a cavity
for that example which will actually go
beyond optical Bloch equations.
It's also nice for you to see that there
is more than the optical Bloch equation,
but it's the same formalism.
And this is when we discuss the damping of the damped vacuum
Rabi oscillations.
I also picked this one example just sort
of as an appetizer, because I can introduce two concepts
for you in this last example.
One is the quantum Zeno effect.
And the other one is the adiabatic elimination
of coherences, which plays a major role
