Optical molasses.
I know some of you will hate it.
Because I've just explained to you that in a standing wave,
we don't have any spontaneous light force.
All we have is the reactive forces stimulated force,
because it is the u, the in-phase oscillation of the
of the atomic dipole operator, which
is responsible for everything.
But now I'm just wearing another hat.
And I tell you that there is a limit, where
the total force can be regarded the sum of the two forces.
So therefore, I'm pretending now that if you
have neo resonant light in the standing wave,
that the force in the standing wave, which you know
is a purely reactive force can now
be written as the sum of the two propagating waves.
And of course, each propagating wave
does a purely dissipating force.
That is, what I'm telling you can be mathematically proven.

That the stimulated force in a standing wave
is equal to the sum of the two dissipative forces
of each traveling wave.
Just keep that in mind whenever you are,
you think you can rigorously distinguish
between the dissipative force and the simulated force.
Keep in mind that a standing wave, which
has only a stimulated force, as I rigorously proved to you,
can alternatively be described as the sum of two
spontaneous light forces, each of which
provided by one of the traveling waves.

Well, it sort of makes sense in the perturbative limit.
You can just take one beam, you can take the other beam
and the combined effect of the two laser beams
is higher order.
So the fact that in some low intensity limit,
this has to be valid is pretty clear.

But just a warning, if you really
want to use the stimulated force here, you are in big trouble.
It's much, much harder to get this result out
of this new wave force.
Because to get this stimulated force with velocity dependence,
requires you to take solutions of the Optical Bloch Equations
which are not steady state, but not adiabatic.
So just a warning, you can do it if you
want with a simulated force.
But I would strongly advise you to first use
the simpler formalism.
You have to go to very different approximation skills and much
more technical complexity if you want to get it out
