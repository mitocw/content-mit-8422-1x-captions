So how do we create the Cirac-Zoller Gate?
So how do we get now the controlled phase
gate out of trapped ions?
So the effect is the following.
Remember, if you have two ions, you
want to change the phase to minus one of this state
only if the two ions are qubit up.
So in other words, we want to do 180 degree rotation of the wave
function, but only if both ions are up.
And the question is, how do we do that?
How just one ion feel what the other ion is doing?
And let me explain that now.
The critical element in Cirac-Zoller case
is the center of mass motion.
We want at some point, say, when this ion is spin up we
swap the quantum information from the ion
to the center of mass motion.
In other words, when this ion is up, we use laser pulses,
I will explain that to you, then all the ions
are moving together.
And then this ion, because they are all moving,
knows that this ion was spin up before.
So it is--
So the center of mass motion, the common dipole
oscillation of all ions together in the trap,
this is the database.
So this is the key idea.
But in order to explain it to you I have to go in two steps.
So let's just take that as a generic level structure.
We have an S-state, and it has two different hyperfine states,
spin up and spin down.
And these are our two qubits.
There may be a p-state, which we have used for laser cooling,
but everything is in the ground state of motion
using cycling cooling, which you've
started in your homework.
And what I want to show you first
is, how we can create a phase gate.
But I'm only focusing on ion one.
So hold the thought, ion two will come in a few moments,
we'll come back.
So what we can do is the following.
Each qubit state has a vibration of structure, ground state
excited state, without center of mass motion.
But then as a function of vibration,
or quantum number for the center of mass motion,
we have G1, G2, E1, E2 and such.
And what we can now do is, let's assume
we have another state, a D-state, which
is an auxiliary state here.
Fortunately ions and atoms have many states.
And we can drive a laser transition from S
to D, which is only in resonance with the first vibration
of excited state to the D-state.
So we use a red attuned sideband here,
which only drives the transition from E1
to the non vibrational state of the auxiliary state.
And that means automatically that this laser does
just nothing to E-node, does nothing to G-node.
Does nothing to G1.
So if we have this Hilbert space of G1, G-node, G1, E-node,
E1, the only transition which is affected here--
or the only state which is affected here, is the E1 state.

OK, I'm talking about a similar ion.
I'm just talking about-- talking to a similar ion right now.
It's really similar.
So if you switch on this laser, what happens
is we simply induce Rabi oscillations.
Simple physics.
The Rabi oscillation, however, after one Rabi period,
has changed the phase of the initial state by minus one.
If you carefully look at what Rabi oscillations are,
the wave function goes up, down, up, down.
But we usually discuss what happens to the probability,
and this is shown in green.
So when we are back in the original state,
we have changed the phase of the wave function by minus one.
So let's just assume that we switch on this laser
to this auxiliary state, and we have a--

well, it's a-- it's a 2 pi pulse in population,
but it makes a phase shift of pi-to-the-wave function,
which is minus one.
So what we have accomplished now is a phase gate,
not between two ions, but we have
a phase gate which, in this Hilbert space, between the--
no qubit-- qubit up, qubit down, I call it ground and excited
state, but the other qubit so to speak,
is the center of mass of motion, 0-1-0-1.
So this is the twos table of the phase gate.

So technically, we have now done a local phase gate
with one ion, where the two qubits are ground and excited
state of the ion.
This is our qubit we want to work with.
But then the second qubit, to realize the phase gate,
was 0-1 of the center of mass vibration.
