Questions?
Colin.
Where does the Markov approximation come in?
The Markov approximation is, so to speak,
the delta function approximation,
which would say that--
I introduced the correlation function between the reservoir
operator and said, the coalition time, tau z,
is very, very short.
The Markov approximation would actually
state that it would actually say in a more radical way,
the correlation time is 0.
And the Born approximation, the fact
that the reservoir is unchanged, came
in when we said the total density
matrix for the second order expression just factorizes.
It factorizes into the environment,
which is just this density matrix of the environment.
It's not changed by the interaction with the system.
And this is the Born approximation.
We just use the same expression for the reservoir independent
of the measurements the reservoir has done.

Other questions?
Yes, Nancy.
[INAUDIBLE]?

This is something very general, I think.
Thank you, actually, for the question.
Whenever we have some damping of the population,
the coherence is only damped with a factor of 1/2.
One way to explain it in a very simple way
is that if you have an amplitude alpha excited and alpha ground,
the population in the excited state is this squared.
So you sometimes make the model that the amplitude
decays with gamma over 2.
But the population, because you take the product,
decays with gamma.
So you would say alpha e and alpha g both decay
with half the rate, but the probabilities
with the total rate.
And the coherence is the product of the amplitudes.
So therefore, when you look at the coherence,
this decays with 1/2 gamma e.
This decays with 1/2 gamma g.
And this is what you get here--
1/2 gamma in state a, 1/2 gamma in state b.
Whereas the probability to be in this state
decays with twice that, because the probability is squared.
So you find that pretty much in any quantum
mechanically correct derivation which
you do about the decay of population coherences.
