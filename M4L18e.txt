Let me introduce the experimental constraint which
is very important by asking the question,
how efficient can evaporative cooling be?
So based on the idealistic model which I've presented to you
so far, what is the highest efficiency of evaporation
you can imagine?
Collin?
I guess in principle, you could remove just one atom.
Like you're saying, [INAUDIBLE] atom.
Yes, you'll remove one atom, you weight it
until you have one atom, which has pretty much all
the energy of the system.
One atom evaporates and your whole system
is as cold as you want to have it.
Of course, you are laughing because this
will take much longer than the [INAUDIBLE] time
of a graduate student at MIT.
In other words, what you realize, time is a premium.
And it's not just the [INAUDIBLE] time
of a graduate student, it's not your patience.
What happens is in a real experiment, there are losses.
There is some form of technical heating
since you are not-- since you don't have a perfect vacuum,
residual gas collisions cause losses.
And it's clear, you have a time budget, which is set by losses.
And either you evaporate in this time budget
or you've lost your atoms for other reasons.
So that's now, that's now what you want to bring in.
We can't make a realistic model of evaporative cooling
without putting in the constraint of time.
And the time constraint will be--
is usually determined by losses, by unavoidable atom losses.
So now we want to understand what
is the speed of evaporation.
And so we assume we truncate, really
move an amount dt dn of atoms above this threshold.
And then the question is how fast can we do it again?
How long does it take for collisions
to replenish the tail of the Maxwell Boltzmann distribution.
But now, you can make an analytic model,
was very pleased when I saw that it
is so easy to actually get a precise analytic model of that.
If eta-- in the asymptotic limit, the eta is very high.
The number of collisions, there is a certain number
of collisions which replenish the tail and you want to know
how fast does it happen.
But now you can use detailed balance in an equilibrium
situation, those atoms will collide with the bulk
of the distribution.
And because they are in a highly improbable state,
most of the outcomes of the collision
will put those energetic atoms back
into the bulk of the [INAUDIBLE] distribution.
So therefore, the number of particles
which arrive in this tail, in equilibrium
is identical to the number of particles
which will leave this tail.

And so all we have to do is we have to calculate how
many such collisions happen.
This is an expression for the fraction
of atoms with the exponential Boltzmann factor, which
you can find in this tail.
And those atoms collide with a velocity which is not
the thermal velocity, the velocity
is larger by square root eta because those are fast.
So by simply multiplying the fraction of the atoms
with the collision rate, we find how many atoms per unit time
are removed from this tail and in detail balance
it means the same number of atoms
is replenished into the tail.
So if you now switch to a continuous model
of evaporation, where we constantly evaporate
the atoms which are produced through elastic collisions
with an energy larger than eta kt.
Then this here is our rate of evaporation.
Since we want to think in terms of time constant,
this rate of evaporation is described by a time
constant for evaporation.
And this time constant is now expressed here
by our experimental control parameter, eta.
Nancy?
So then you are saying that the collisions are putting that
into the lower velocity states.
Are these [INAUDIBLE] that are more defined in the Maxwell
Boltzmann distribution?
So then you will, like the system [INAUDIBLE]
it automatically goes into a new Maxwell
Yes.
Boltzmann solution.
And that's what determines [INAUDIBLE].
But then you are saying that the collisions
are putting [INAUDIBLE] with the lower velocities.
So the collisions are [INAUDIBLE]?

No, we assume here that we have only--
that the truncation is only weakly perturbing the Maxwell
Boltzmann distribution.
And at least the easiest way to figure out
how many atoms are produced, per unit time,
if atoms in this truncated Maxwell Boltzmann distribution
collide, they produce with a certain time constant, atoms
which we populate the tail.
And I can estimate what is this number of--
what is the number of atoms which are per unit time fit
into the tail by assuming I do not have a truncated Boltzmann
distribution.
I have a full Boltzmann distribution.
And I simply calculate what is the total elastic condition
made of then of the atoms in this tail.
So in other words, I want to know how many atoms
are fed into the tail.
But I get this number of--
I get these number of collisions by saying in detailed balance,
this number of collisions is the same
as the number of collisions in the full Boltzmann
distribution, which goes backward.
And with that argument I can immediately
write down an expression for what
is the condition rate which produces high energy atoms.

Think about it.
It's subtle, but it's fairly straightforward.
I make the assumption, here, that eta is sufficiently large,
that I can use sort of properties of the equilibrium
Maxwell Boltzmann distribution to estimate those eight
constants.
And actually when I found the analytic expression
I could compare to and to [INAUDIBLE], which
was much more complicated and used
truncated Boltzmann distribution.
And in the asymptotic limit of large eta,
I was in full agreement with the other results.
OK, so yes, we have an expression now
for the time constant of evaporation,
how fast evaporation happens because
of elastic collisions which populate the high energy tail.
But usually when you have a time constant,
you want to express it by another physical time.
And the physical time which characterizes a gas
is the rate of elastic collisions per atom in a gas.
So therefore, I want to express the rate for evaporation,
the rate for which atoms are produced in the high energy
tail as a ratio lambda with the time
between elastic collisions.
And so we realize, of course, that the atoms which
have enough energy to evaporate are not produced
in every elastic collision.
Actually there is an exponential factor, e to the eta,
because it's only a small part of those elastic collisions
which happen, which produces a high energy
atom which can escape.
OK, so with that we know how many atoms we
can lose by evaporation and this is our expression.
But now we have a complete pretty realistic,
but a wonderful toy model to discuss all aspects
of evaporative cooling.
We have our control parameter, eta,
which sets the threshold at which atoms can evaporate.
And this factor eta determines the two relevant parameters,
alpha, which is the efficiency of evaporation,
and lambda, which is the speed of evaporation.
If we set eta very high, following Collin's suggestion,
we can put it so high that one atom can cool the whole system.
One lost atom, one evaporative atom, one evaporative-- one
evaporated atom can cool all the other atoms
to very low temperature.
But we know that this will take too much time.
So in other words, we have a compromise.
If you set eta very high, each atom which evaporates
provides a lot of cooling power.
But high eta means we have exponential slowdown
in the evaporation rate.
And we have to wait longer and longer
or we never get into evaporation because inelastic collisions
and losses has taken its effect.
So therefore it seems clear that this interplay
between efficiency and speed is asking for compromise.
And this is what we have to realize
