So to wrap up this chapter, what we have discussed here is--
I haven't really discussed resonant scattering.
I've now focused on the function Gb.
I focused on what happens to the state b.
But this is-- and this is what I want to for you now--
the only element we need to discuss resonant scattering.
So when we have an atom in the ground state,
and a photon comes along, and it takes the atom to the excited
state b.
And then we go back to the same state--
could be also another state--
by emitting a photon k prime epsilon prime.

And the relevant matrix element of the time evolution operator,
which is the T matrix, involve now the matrix element
the initial energy minus the intermediate energy.
And the critical part is really--
you can do it mathematically, I just
showed it here as a summary--
the critical part is really the propagation of the state
b, which is problematic.
But we have now learned, and it transfers exactly
to the light scattering problem, that we
have to include now radiative shifts and an imaginary part
for the decay to the time evolution.
And that would actually mean or that
means that this diagram here for light scattering,
we have added other terms to it.
And the other terms are, of course,
that when we scatter light of an excited state like this,
the excited state can sort of emit photons and reabsorb them.
And it can do that too.
So we go to that state.
It can do that to infinite order.
So in other words, for any problem now
which involves the excited state,
we replace the [INAUDIBLE] order propagation of the state b.
And mathematically, it means we replace this function
by the resolvent, which we have calculated
by doing an approximation to the [INAUDIBLE].
Questions?
Question, having found no resonant-- off resonance,
excuse me.
Pardon?
Is this discretion of the [? Tfi ?] value
for off resonance?
Yeah, OK what happens is if you're off resonant,
you don't have a problem.
This extra term delta and gamma, the radiative shift
and the line widths, only matter when the black term
is close to zero.
If you have a large detuning delta here,
then the small shift in the line widths don't matter.
So everything we have done by correcting
the naked propagation of the state
b by the correct propagation with these infinite emission
and re-absorption of virtual photons,
this is only needed if the denominator is zero.
And then we have to figure out what else happens.
And what else happens is obtained
in higher order with this non [INAUDIBLE] treatment.
Other questions?
