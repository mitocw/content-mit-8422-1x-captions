I actually use this cartoon picture
to develop a mathematical model for evaporative cooling, which
is still the simplest model for evaporative cooling
which you can find in the literature.
In any event, but if you think in that way, every time you
remove a few percent of the atoms,
you realize that you should think in the logarithmic way.
Every time you lose a certain percentage of your atoms,
you decrease the temperature by a certain percentage.
So in the end, if you think either in discrete steps,
or continuously as a function of time,
things should happen exponentially.
If you want to characterize what happens into the system,
we should correlate the percentage
of temperature change to the percentage
of the change in number.
And here we have a coefficient.
And this coefficient would give us
an exponential, would give us the power law,
how temperature and number are related.
Or, mathematically, alpha, which characterizes
how much cooling do you get for each loss in the number?
It's a logarithmic derivative of number with temperature.
All other quantities also scale as power loss of the number.
Let me just assume we are in a potential.
We have d dimensions.
So if you have an harmonic oscillator, it's r2.
If you have a linear type, r1.
And, for simplicity, I took d, the number of dimensions
out, so you choose delta to get 1d,
2d, or whatever, to get an harmonic
oscillator or linear potential.
OK.
Because of equipartition, the temperature,
which is a measure for kinetic energy,
is equal to the potential energy.
And the potential energy is r to the power d over delta.
So therefore, the size of the atoms in the trap
scales with temperature with the power law.
But if the temperature scales with a power law
with a number, then the volume of the atoms, the temperature,
everything scales with the number of atoms
to some exponent.
So everything is sort of exponential
according to power laws.
So I mentioned already the volume.
And what I've shown here is just the two parameters which
determine all exponential.
The volume goes with the product of delta alpha.
The density goes with something.
The phase space density is density over temperature
to the 3/2.
The coalition rate is n sigma v. So
everything scales with n to the alpha.
And all the coefficients are given here.
So the question is, what is alpha?
So it seems delta is our trapping potential.
Once we know alpha, we've a clear prediction
what evaporative cooling can do for us.
Well, alpha was, remember, it told us
how much we lower temperature or energy
when we lose a number of atoms.
So therefore, all we have to figure out
is, when we evaporate an atom, how much energy
does it take with it?
And therefore, alpha will be determined by--
some people call it the knife edge.
If we truncate the trap at eta k t,
I showed you a cartoon where I use
the x to chop off the tail of the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution at 4kt.
So eta would have been four.
So this is what we control experimentally.
At what energy do we allow atoms to leak out of the trap?
All
Right.
So if you set a threshold of, let's say, 4kt,
4kt is the minimum energy for atoms to leak out.
But some will be a little bit faster.
In other words, they are not creeping over the edge.
They are jumping.
They are zipping over the edge.
But because everything is thermal,
this extra energy is on the order of kt or half kt.
And in the first analysis, we can neglect it.
So in other words, we can see that each atom, when
it escapes, takes away the energy eta kt.
And eta is the famous eta parameter,
which we determine experimentally
when we evaporate.
Any questions so far?

Right now, I've pretty much gone through definitions.
And now I simply look at energy conservation.
The total energy, so now let's look at how much energy--
what is the change of energy doing evaporation?
Well, for N atoms, this is the kinetic energy.
And the extra potential energy for an harmonic oscillator,
it would be the same.
Equipartition for another power law potential.
We have to introduce this delta parameter, which
defines the power law of the trapping potential.
So that means the following.
Originally, this describes the number of the total energy.
After an evaporation step, delta N is negative.
I've lost some atoms and delta T is negative.
I am now at a lower temperature and a lower atom number.
And the difference is simply the energy
taken away by the number of atoms dN which have evaporated.
With that, by just rewriting that,
I get a result for the alpha coefficient, which tells us,
what is the percentage, in temperature--
how many percent is the temperature
lowered when I lose a certain percentage
of the number of atoms?
Actually 1% of the top of the number of atoms
gives alpha percent in change in temperature.
And this is the alpha coefficient.
So I have an analytic expression for that.
And sure, you realize if you put your cut eta not
at higher energy, if you cut at low energy,
then your alpha coefficient can even turn negative,
because then the atoms which evaporate
do not have more than the average energy.
But actually then, the model breaks down.
OK.

Alpha characterizes how much more than the average energy
is removed by escaping atoms.
So that's now very simple.
Once we know what is the threshold of the trap,
eta kt, at what energy do we leak out atoms?
We have a complete description.
What is the energy, the phase space
density, and such and such, after we've
lost a number of atoms?
But you've realized, at least for all of you who
do the experiments, something is missing here
that sounds almost too ideal.
We just evaporate.
And we can freely peek at what is the energy
or what is the energy threshold and such?
The experiment is more constrained.
And we have to work harder to get into this [INAUDIBLE]
