Before I give you the general derivation of the master
equation, let me talk about what we
have learned from this example, and what
the general procedure is.
The first thing is, our goal is to find a differential
equation for the density matrix of the system.
Oh, I just remembered, there was one thing I wanted to mention.
In the previous derivation with the beam splitter,
I started with the pure state and the pure state developed
into a statistical mixture.
And this statistical mixture would then
transform the next beam splitter into
another statistical mixture.
I derived the differential equation for you
for the first step from the pure state
to the statistical mixture, but if you
would spend a few minutes, you could immediately
show that you can start with an arbitrary density matrix,
look how it evolves through the beam splitter,
and you get exactly the same differential equation.
So the general procedure is we want
a differential equation, how the density matrix evolves
with time.
And this will be obtained by finding an operator which acts
on the initial density matrix.
This operator is not a unitary operator,
because we are performing measurements
through the environment.
Even if you don't actually perform them,
once we dump something into the environment,
it's out of our control.
And anybody could go and perform a measurement.
And so we should assume that this measurement
has been taken.
It's one of those quantum mechanical things
that you don't even have to care whether somebody does it.
The environment does it for you.
So this operator is called a Liouvillean operator.
It sometimes goes-- and I haven't really traced down
why--
it's called sometimes "super operator."
I mean, I know what superconductivity is,
but I don't know what the super powers of this operator are,
but that's just the language you will find.
The second thing which we have used
is that the evolution of the system
can be obtained from the time evolution of the total system
by performing a trace over the degrees of freedom
of the environment.
This was exactly what we actually did when we said,
the system continues with probability p0
in one state and probability p1 in the other state.
The operation which led to this density matrix
was exactly the partial trace.
So this is the second general feature
which we have to implement.
Thirdly, if we could do one and two exactly,
we would have an exact formulation
for a small part of the quantum system,
no matter how complicated the environment is.
In practice, we can solve the equations only
when we make simplifying assumptions
about the environment.
One is it is large.
And more important, therefore, it's unchanging.
And this is the Born approximation.
And the second feature is it has a short correlation
time, tau z.
In the beam splitter, I've made the assumption
that there is no correlation between different beam
splitters.
In the derivation which I want to walk you through right now,
you will see explicitly where the correlation time enters.
And this is called the Mark ov approximation.
And finally-- this is number four--
the whole possibility to derive a master equation
hinges on the fact that we have different time scales which
are very different.
We are interested in the evolution of our system.
We want to know how it relaxes, and this is on a time scale
1 over gamma.
So we call this slow.
We are interested in a variation of our system--
the atomic system or the photon state
which passes through the beam splitter.
And this time scale has to be much slower
than the fluctuations of the environment.
So therefore, if the environment has
fluctuations-- which in the beam splitter model
were assumed to be 0.
It was delta function in time.
If that correlation time is much smaller than the time
it takes for the system to relax and to evolve,
that opens a window, delta t.
And this is the time scale of the master equation.
Just to give you one example for the spontaneous emission,
the correlation time, tau z, would
be the time it takes the photon to disappear from the atom.
And the photon has disappeared from the atom
when it is one wavelength away.
So typically, the correlation time
of the vacuum for spontaneous emission
is one cycle of the optical frequency.
It's very, very fast.
Whereas typical decay times of the excited states
are nanoseconds.
It's six orders of magnitude slower.
And this is what we describe.
But on a time scale of a femtosecond,
of one optical cycle, the photon has not detached from the atom,
and it could go, actually, back to the atom.
During that time-- we talked a little bit about it
when we did this diagrammatic discussions of resonance
scattering-- for very, very early times,
you don't have exponential decay.
Because you cannot do the approximations where we
approximated the kernel by something which was completely
energy dependent.
And so what happens at such short times,
we encounter here, again, at such short times,
we will not have a simple description of the system.
So the last point, let me summarize-- our goal
is that we describe the density matrix of the system.
And we want to find the Liouville operator
or some matrix which acts on it.
And because we will integrate over
time steps which are larger than the correlation
time of the system, we can also call it
a coarse-grained evolution.
Any questions about that?
