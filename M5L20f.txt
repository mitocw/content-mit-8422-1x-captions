OK.
Let's go from one particle physics, back to fermions.
And let me now present to you how Leon Cooper really
found the key ingredients to the longstanding problem,
how do electrons pair in a superconductor?
And he did the following, he made
an artificial simplification, which you can see is ingenious.
He assumed the following, he just
wanted to understand how do two electrons pair.
But he simply assumed that those two electrons are
on top of a Fermi C. So he pretty much said,
I want to solve the problem where
two electrons just scatter through all available states,
and then figure out if an infinitesimal attraction
between those electron leads to binding.
Of course, in the real world the electrons in the Fermi C
are identical to those electrons,
to those two special electrons, and they are constantly
exchanged.
But he simply made this artificial model,
and then of course we can immediately right down
the equivalent equation.
It's exactly the same formalism, except for when
we integrate over all energies here,
we integrate-- yes, we integrate over the 3-dimensional energy.
But now we integrate only over a small region
on top of the Fermi C.
And everything looks the same.
We just have sometimes subtract the Fermi energy.
All energies are measured not relative to zero,
but relative to the Fermi energy.
If you compare it to the equation I just showed you
for similar particle bound state,
you pretty much see that everything
is the same except for energies immediately
relative to the Fermi energy.
And secondly, we are not integrating from zero
as before, we start integrating from the Fermi energy.
And that means now that in this area of integration,
the 3-dimensional density of states is constant,
namely it's the density for where
the energy is the Fermi energy, and can
be pulled out of the integral.
And then we have the same logarithmic divergence
estimating two dimensions.
So therefore the problem of two electrons scattering
on the surface of the Fermi c, means
that we have essentially the same condition
for the electrons as if they would live in two dimensions.

Question.
If the world were 4-dimensional, and we
would have the same physics, we had two electrons
on the surface of the Fermi c, with the physics of the two
electrons in that regard, be 4 minus one dimension,
three dimension, or would it be two dimensions?

[INAUDIBLE]
Well, that's exactly the question.
Let's say-- let's assume we had four spatial dimensions.
For this kind of analysis it's effective density
of states on the Fermi surface.
Now 2-dimensional?
Or is it 3-dimensional?
It should be three, right?
It's kind of like, you remove one dimension
by restricting yourself to kind of an area [INAUDIBLE]?
It is the more you know, if you say,
the particles have momentum on the Fermi surface.
Then, if the Fermi surface fixes one momentum, and now
they have three different momenta.
So in that sense, the motion on this surface in 4-dimensions
are 3-dimensional.
But it was sort of a trick question to some extent.
Because here we have reformulated everything
with energy, and the question-- and the answer is now,
the density of state is constant.
It is the 4-dimensional density of states,
but evaluated at the Fermi energy.
So therefore no matter in what dimensions
you are, because you are restricted to the Fermi C,
you integrate over energy with a constant density of states.
And if you were the constant density
state out of the integral, you have a logarithmic divergence
and you pretty much get the same answer.
So therefore, the physics in four dimensions
would be the same.
It would be the fermions which live on this Fermi surface
would just marginally pair.
Then how do you explain the reduction of dimensions?
Where does one more dimension [INAUDIBLE]
things that are still on the 3-dimensional surface of four
dimensions?
Oh well the motion, you can see on the Fermi surface
is n minus one dimension.
But the energetic analysis all of us
uses a constant density of states,
and the constant density of state
is characteristic for two dimensions.
So you have both.
So if you have analyze the motion, yes.
You have-- you have n minus one dimensions.
But if you look at the question of bound states,
you encounter the same situation as in two dimensions,
because the effective density of states is constant.

OK.
So with that the message I have for you is
Cooper pairing is a signal particle effect.
A single particle trapped to an arbitrarily weak potential
in two dimensions, and the only many-body physics, which
allows those Cooper pairs to form
is, that you have a Pauli's blocking
that you will Fermi C, which prevents particles
from going into the deep Fermi C. They stay on the surface,
and therefore they form weak pairs.
So the only many-body physics which
we need for that kind of pairing is Pauli blocking.
Mark?

Sorry, could you explain to me what is
the Er in the previous slide?
Er was the cut off-- we were cutting off the potential it is
just short--
we didn't use a delta potential, we
used a square well potential, which extends out to r.
And Er is the recall energy associated with r.
It's one over r squared, with a few H bars and M
to give the units of energy.

Colin?
If you could go back to the--
So, I could imagine tailor expanding my density of states
any dimension around the Fermi energy.
But, you know, I'll always have the constant term.
The first term, it's 3D, it's either
one half or some linear term.
Doesn't that imply that even if you give this system
any infinitesimal amount of energy
then might-- that integral no longer diverges.

No, the question of divergence is robust.
It depends only on the leading term and not on the expansion.

If you're a divergence, you're not changing it
by a small correction term.
Because a small correction term is on top of unity.
If you start with the density of states at zero,
which goes with epsilon to some power,
we have a different situation.
But you catch really the physics by saying,
you take a contingency of states.
Anyway let me just go on and say, we should now figure out,
and this is also important when it
comes to pairing, which pairs are the most important ones.
And the message I want to give you here,
the pairs which are most important ones,
are the ones which have zero momentum because those pairs
can scatter to all states on the Fermi surface
without violating momentum conservation.
However, if you have the total momentum of the two particles
which is non-zero, they can only scatter
on this segment of the sphere, and you got already the message
that the higher the density of state
the better it is for the binding.
So therefore, the pairs which hve the largest
binding energies will be the ones
with total momentum of zero.
