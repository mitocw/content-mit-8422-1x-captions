So the dressed atom.
I was waiting until this point to introduce a dressed atom
picture for you, because the dressed atom picture is
the natural picture you want to think about, for instance,
for the Mollow triplet, and we had already
some discussion about it.
But it is also the natural picture
you want to think about it when you describe
the stimulated light force.
And I mentioned already, it is the dressed atom picture which
will help me to give you the physical picture behind if you
have strong laser beams, why blue detuned light cools
and not red detuned light.
So you should be motivated now to learn about the dressed atom
picture.
But first I have to say, it's not anything new,
what I'm teaching you.
It has exactly the same physics in it
as the optical block equations.
It's just that the optical block equations are
often more complicated, and they don't
provide the clear insight.
And the reason is the following.
Often when you describe a physical phenomenon,
you can choose one basis set, or you can use another basis set.
But if you're in the wrong basis,
you get the correct results, but in the wrong basis,
you just can't describe the physics easily.
So in other words, with the dressed atom picture,
I want to introduce dressed atom states
for you, which are no longer the ground state and the excited
state.
I want to treat the atoms dressed up
by the laser beam, which is one mode
of the electromagnetic field.
So the atoms, together with this one laser beam,
will be partially excited, partially in the ground state.
And these partially excited atoms, this
is the dressed atom basis.
But if you think in terms of those states,
you have a much easier way to formulate
certain physical processes.
Exactly processes where you high laser power.
At low laser power, the dress states
are identical to the naked states,
to the ground and excited states.
But at high laser power, at infinite laser power,
the two dress states are the symmetric and antisymmetric
equal superposition of ground and excited state.
So that's what we want to describe now.

So the difference to the optical block equation
is that we are now really looking
for the combined state of the atom
and the electromagnetic field.
So what we want to do is, this is sort of our picture
that we have.
This is our Hamiltonian.
We have the atom interacting with a vacuum
through spontaneous emission, with a reservoir
of empty motes.
But now it also interacts with a laser beam.
And you'll remember when we did the master equation,
we looked at this.
We derived a master equation for this.
And then we added in the unitary time
evolution due to a laser beam.
But what we want to do now is we want
to first take care of the atom in the laser beam
almost exactly in an exact diagonalization.
And once we have re-diagonalized that,
we have now eigenstates which we call the dress states.
Then we allow, not the ground and excited state.
We then allow the dress states to emit into the vacuum.
And this is the formulation we want to obtain now.

Let me make one comment before I go
through a few simple equation.
And that's the following.
If I want to treat this system almost exactly,
I have two choices.
I use a strong laser beam so I could,
as we have discussed several times,
simply use a time-dependent external electric field.
The laser beam is e0 times cosine omega t,
and I just introduced it in the Hamiltonian.
And you can get everything I describe now for you
out of this Hamiltonian.
However, there is an alternative way,
and this one is I simply assume that the laser beam is
described by the fully quantized field, and I use a Fuchs state.
I just assume n, the number of photons, is very big.
And that corresponds-- and this is, at least for that purpose,
a valid description of the laser beam.
So what happens is you really want to look through that.
I've really learned a lot by comparing
the purely classical treatment of the laser beam
and the fully quantized description of the laser beam.
The results are the same.
They are absolutely identical.
And what you will see is, by a bunch of approximations,
we reduce a total Hamiltonian to--
you've seen it many times-- a 2 by 2 matrix.
And whether you start with a classical field
or whether you start with a fully quantized field,
if you make the right approximation,
you get the same 2 by 2 matrix.
But there is a difference.
This Hamiltonian is time-independent.
a dega a.
Time-independent Hamiltonian.
If you take a classical field, which is cosine omega lt,
you don't have a time-independent Hamiltonian.
You have a driven system, and your wave function
has an external time dependence.
The laser beam is driving the wave function.
So in other words, you have two choices
when you want to describe how an atom interacts
with a strong laser beam.
You can use a fully-quantized field, which is conceptually
a little bit more complicated, because we've quantized
the electromagnetic field.
But then everything is time-independent,
and everything I do here is really easy.
I can go over it now in five minutes,
and you understand everything.
Well, in your homework, I've already
asked you at an earlier homework to look
at simply the two-level system driven by a classical field.
And in your next homework, number 10, your last homework,
I'm asking you now to interpret the solution
with a classical field.
And it's actually a little bit a challenge
to take the time-dependent wave function,
and read the physics out of this time-dependent wave
function, which corresponds to the physics we derive
in the dressed atom picture.
But you have two ways.
One is a classical field.
Then the wave function, the Hamiltonian is time-dependent,
and the wave function is time-dependent.
Or here, I start with a quantum field,
and everything is time-independent.
But the solutions are identical.
Well, one is a time-dependent wave function,
one is a time-independent, but if you interpret
the solution in terms of what happens to the physical system,
you will find exactly the same.
So in other words, I decided I do the easy part here, which
is the fully-quantized part.
And this is probably what will get stuck in your head.
But since I think it's an important pedagogical exercise,
you have to go through the homework
