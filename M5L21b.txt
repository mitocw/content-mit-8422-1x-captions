I decided to focus on two aspects.
One is I want to talk about a special way of trapping ions,
because there is one difference for ions.
Ions, until recently, have not been
trapped in stationary traps.
They've only been trapped in dynamic traps.
So you cannot trap ions by simply putting an electric
potential around it, because the divergence of the electric
field is zero.
And that means there's always one direction in space
where the ions are dragged out.
You cannot have an inward force from all directions.
So therefore, when you want to use electric fields,
you can only use dynamic traps.
Well, for the experts I should say, you can--

this does not apply for the optical dipole trap.
We know how we can create trapping potentials
for neutral atoms using the optical dipole trap.
And very recently, a group was able to trap ions
not with electric and magnetic fields provided
by electrodes or radio frequency,
but by [? in a ?] focused laser beam.
So it's a very new development.
But it uses exactly the mechanism
which has been used for neutral atoms.
So when it comes to dynamic traps, the standard tool
traps which have been used for ion trapping,
one is the Penning trap, which I do not
want to describe in detail.
The Penning trap uses a quadrupole configuration
of two--
of positive charge.
And then, you have a ring with negative charge.
That means that an ion is confined here
but would see anti-confinement in the outward direction.
Now, what do you do with the anti-confinement?
Well, the solution is that you add a magnetic field.
And what happens now is the particle
is well-confined axially.
But radially when it wants to move out,
it's turned into a cyclotron orbit
and therefore stays trapped.
So this is the principle of Penning traps, where
the confinement in the axial direction is electrostatic
and the confinement in x, y is through cyclotron motion.
OK.
It's wonderful physics to describe the motion of ions
in this trap.
It's the combination of an axial motion, cyclotron motion,
magnetron motion.
It's very interesting physics.
And for many years, Dave Pritchard here at MIT
used such Penning traps to measure the masses, determine
the masses, of ions with the highest precision ever
possible.
MIT still has the world record of the most precise
measurements at the 10 to the minus 11 level.
