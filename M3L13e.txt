We're interested in a differential equation.
We want to sort of find out what happens
when we have the density matrix interacting
with the environment all the time.
And this can be simulated by beam splitters
by using many beam splitters with a small degree
of reflection.
So we want to simplify this result now
for the case of many beam splitters.
And each of them has a small tipping angle, theta.
And for later convenience, I define theta to be gamma times
delta t over 2.
That's just my definition of theta.
So what we have in mind now is that we
start with a system psi.
And we have many such beam splitters
within infinitesimal tipping angle.
Each beam splitter has the vacuum at its input state.
And we always perform a measurement.
If I take the equation above, we find a differential equation
for the density matrix, which looks like this.
So all I've done is I've used the equation above,
and I've done a Taylor expansion in the small angle theta.
And the reason why I brought in the square root,
we had cosine theta.
The first order Taylor expansion,
or the lowest order Taylor expansion from cosine
is 1 minus theta squared.
So I get the square root squared.
So I get gamma, which appears here.
And then I divide by delta t.
So this is just an exact mathematical expression.
And the next step is to form a differential equation.
But before I do that, I want to emphasize the two features
we are using here.
They sort of enter automatically,
but these are the two big assumptions
we make when we derive a master equation.
The first one is that we always have a vacuum state
as the input.
So in other words, the environment
is always in the same state, which is a vacuum state.
And this is sort of called a Born approximation.
What it means is that we do a measurement here,
but the vacuum is not changing.
In other words, we are not overloading the vacuum
with so many photons that suddenly, the vacuum is
no longer in the vacuum state.
Or in the case of spontaneous emission,
the vacuum can just take as many photons as you dump into it.
They disappear so quickly that for all practical purposes,
the environment stays in the vacuum state.
So this is called the Born approximation.
The environment is not changing.
It has enough capacity not to be modified by the measurement
process.
And the second thing is that the vacuum is always
in the same state.
And there are no correlations.
From here to here to here, there is no memory effect.
Everything is completely uncorrelated.
So the environment is uncorrelated.
It has no memory.
Its correlation function is a delta function.
And this is called Markov approximation.
So these are the two effects which are important.
One is, no memory for the environment--
delta function correlation, Markov approximation--
the two are, of course, related.
And the environment is always in the same state.
So remember, this is the change for the density matrix, and
alpha, beta, where the original parameters of the density
matrix for the input state.
So I can now rewrite everything as a differential equation.

The density matrix has a derivative
for the diagonal matrix elements and for the coherences.
Here, we have plus gamma.
Here, we have minus gamma, rho, 1, 1.
Makes sense, because we conserve the trace.
We have unity probability that we have still a system,
and therefore, the two diagonal matrix elements,
the population, some of them cannot change with time.
And for the coherence, we have gamma over 2.
And if you are familiar with optical Bloch equations, which
we derive next, we can say that this
means if 0 is the ground state, that the ground state changes
because there is--
call it spontaneous emission-- from the excited state.
This equation would say that the excited state decays case
with a rate gamma.
And sometimes, you may have pondered
about the factors of 2 appearing, which
also appears here--
that when the excited state decays with the rate gamma,
we have a factor here for the coherences, which
is gamma over 2.
So what we have accomplished in contrast to,
let's say, Einstein's equation with the Einstein a
and b coefficient, which led to rate
equations for the population, we have now a new feature.
We have an equation for the coherences.
And we find a decay of the coherences
with half the rate as the decay of the population.
Questions?
So if you want, you could rewrite this model
for a photon which goes through beam splitters,
undergoes measurement, you can rewrite it
for an atomic wave function.
And you measure whether the atom is in the excited and ground
state.
And the equation for the measurement performed
on the atom is exactly as the equation
by which the beam splitter acts on the photon state.
So what I've shown here is very specific for a single photon,
because I could use simple equations.
