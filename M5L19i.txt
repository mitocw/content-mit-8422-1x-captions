So we've talked about Bose-Einstein condensates
in an homogeneous system just to lay the groundwork.
We've talked about Bose-Einstein condensates in traps
in inhomogeneous system.
Now we want to talk about Bose-Einstein condensates
in optical lattices.
Well, there are two reasons why we want to do that.
One is we want to use the Bose-Einstein condensate
to obtain deeper insight into the properties of matter.
And a lot of forms of matter appear in periodic lattices.
So if you put a Bose-Einstein condensate
into periodic potential, we can at least
understand some of the properties
of crystalline matter or electrons
which are block waves in a periodic potential.
So this is one reason why.
The other reason why you want to go to optical lattices
is the following.
Ideal Bose-Einstein condensates are trivial.
Weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates are entertaining.
And you can write a lot of papers,
have a lot of fun of it, develop your methods.
Also mildly intellectually interesting,
because how those weak interactions manifest itself
in vortices and all that is really rich and interesting.
But the conceptional problems appear when
you go to strong interactions.
Strongly correlated matter is where mean field descriptions
no longer work, this is really the frontier
of our understanding of many body system.
And when you want to be there, you
want to create a strongly correlated system,
and strongly correlated systems means
that the interaction energy dominates over kinetic energy.
In Bose-Einstein condensates, you
can only go so far with increasing interactions
via Feshbach resonances, because you
get into some interlaced collisions.
So that's one knob to turn.
You go to larger and larger scheduling [INAUDIBLE]
and crank up that interactions.
But if atoms strongly interact, they start to do bad chemistry.
They start to spin flip.
They do other things.
And in some cases, you keep it under control.
In others, you just can't keep it under control.
But another way to get to strong interactions,
means you could use the kinetic energy.
It's the ratio of the two which matters.
And when you put particles in a lattice, well,
the lattice actually reduces the kinetic energy.
You may know from condensed metaphysics that in a light
is an effective mass, which is higher than the bare mass,
therefore you have reduced the kinetic energy.
Or if you want another hand-waving approximation,
the kinetic energy is given by the bandwidths.
And if the tunneling becomes slower and slower,
the widths of your band becomes narrower,
and your kinetic energy is less.
So anyway, I can give you many hand-waving approximations
why, in a lattice, kinetic energy is reduced,
and repulsive energy is probably enhanced,
because instead of having your atoms spread out,
they are bunched up at each lattice side
into a higher density cloud.
So anyway, maybe you interested in parity potentials,
or you're interested in quantum systems
with strong correlations.
For whatever reasons, you want optic lattices.
Now I have here a few slides which
introduce parity potentials, but it is really
just the single particle physics in the parity potential.
It has nothing to do with quantum gases.
This could be the first lecture of how to describe electrons
in a metal.
So let me just quickly go through,
assuming that almost all of you are familiar.
But I use those slides, also, just
to give you a few definitions and introduce a few symbols.
So this is simple, boring, exactly understood physics.
We haven't Hamiltonian, which has kinetic energy and a parity
potential, which is our lattice potential.
It's rather trivial to solve that exactly.
For your wave function, you use Bloch's theorem
and divide it by an exponential factor with quasi momentum
times a periodic function.
And if you know solve Schrodinger's equation,
you want to use Fourier space.
You Fourier analyze the wave function.
You Fourier analyze the potential.
And since the potential is periodic,
sine squared potential has only three Fourier components.
It's c0 plus minus 1 times the periodicity of the lattice.
You do a Fourier expansion for your periodic wave function.
And if you insert that into Schrodinger's equation,
well, the Fourier transform has turned the differential
equation into an algebraic equation,
because the second derivative simply becomes now
k squared or q squared.
So in other words, you have a set of linear equations.

There is an index, which is the bent
index, how high do you want to go and usually you truncate it.
But it's the same trivial story, which
is told in all textbooks of condensed metaphysics.
If you have no bent structure, well, you have the parabola,
but to prepare for bent structure,
I've broken it down here in the first [INAUDIBLE].
And if you now introduce a lattice,
you introduce bent gaps, and you go from the left to the middle
to the right for stronger and stronger lattices.
So the case which I will be focused on,
because it is the most extreme case away free space,
is this case, which is called the tight-binding limit, where
the potential energy of the lattice is large.
And large means, compared with the kinetic energy of the prion
zone, which is k squared--
k is the lattice momentum-- k squared over 2m,
and that's a recoil energy.
So that what I mentioned this parameter here
is the [? depth ?] of the lattice measured
in recoil energies, recoil energies of the photon,
because that is the kinetic energy of the free gas
at the prion zone.
OK, there are a few things which immediately simplify that.
Once we are in the tight-binding limit,
our lattice is really deep.
And each side forms an harmonic oscillator.
And the oscillator frequency is analytically
given by the [? depth ?] of the lattice.
And the solution here for the lowest bend
is that the lowest bend, the energy in the lower
bend, the dispersion relation is,
well, we have an harmonic oscillator at each side in xyz,
so the average energy in the lowest bend
is the zero point energy in xy and z, 3/2 h by omega naught.
And then we have a cosine [INAUDIBLE] bent structure,
where q is the cosine momentum.
And what appears here as the only interesting parameter
is j, and j is--

I think this 4 should be 4j is the bandwidth.
