So the claim is that this method, called quantum Monte
Carlo wave function method, is fully
equivalent to the optical block equations.
And I want to prove it to you by showing
that if I take a density matrix, which is an ensemble
average over many of realizations of those Quantum
Monte Carlo trajectories, that then this density
matrix follows the differential equation, which
is the optical block equation.
And the proof is shown here.
So what I told you is the density matrix after time delta
t.
Has now two matrix elements, one with probability delta p.
And this photon has been emitted system
is in the current state with probability 1 minus delta p.

We evolve the quantum state with a Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.

And then all what is done in the next few steps we
assume that delta t is small.
We do a tailor expansion of the exponent.
We neglect quadratic terms in delta t
and then we come to this line.

And if we write this as rho of t plus delta t
minus the original rho of t, we find
that this follows a differential equation which is exactly
the optical block equations.
So therefore what we implemented as a form of doing many,
many quantum measurements in the environment
is a procedure which is rigorously
the same as the optical block equations, which
we derive using a master equation approach.

OK.
This method is very powerful for the following reasons.
If you simulate a density matrix with N internal states,
or N external internal states--
I should have said with N quantum states,
you need N times N matrix elements,
which can become quite a memory hog for your computer.
The wave function, at any given moment, has only N components.
So therefore there is a computational advantage
in using a stochastic wave function
approach over simulation of the density matrix.
The second thing is that a lot of people, especially
experimentalists, like this approach
