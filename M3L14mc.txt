Let us discuss the case when we go to very high power, very
high Rabi frequency.
At that moment-- you can just see it in the solution
on the page above--
the z component of the optical block vector goes 0, becomes 0.
That means there is no population
difference between excited and ground state anymore.
We often describe the limit of high power
by introducing a saturation parameter, which
is defined here.
Saturation is discussed in more details
in part one of the course, but I want
to relate it here to the solution with the optical block
vector.
The z component, which is the difference
between ground and excited state population,
becomes now-- has a very simple form.
1 plus 1, 1 over 1 plus s.
The population to be in the excited state is 1/2.
Half That's what we get at infinite power.
And then if the power is finite, you just
multiply it by s times s plus 1.
And the power broadened line widths is the natural line
widths, which just gives the line widths
in the limit of low power.
And then you multiply with square root 1 plus s.
So what does it mean to have a saturation parameter of 1?
Well, if you just look how it was defined,
if you have the ground and the excited state,
at a saturation parameter of--
first, at a saturation parameter of infinite,
you have a 50-50 population.
And at a saturation parameter of 1, you're half way to 50-50.
That means you have 3/4 population here,
and 1/4 population there.
So at this case, the number of photons emitted per unit time,
which is all always given by this formula,
becomes now gamma over 4.
So at a saturation parameter of 1,
the emission rate is gamma over 4.
At a saturation parameter of infinity,
the spontaneous emission rate is gamma over 2.
Any questions about steady state solution?
[? Tino. ?]
So what we derive right now is a spontaneous emission rate.
Do the optical Bloch equations say anything
about the stimulated emission, or is that
the fact that it doesn't happen in the same mode?
Stimulated emission is built in the optical Bloch
equations for negligible damping contain Rabi oscillation.
And Rabi oscillation is the stimulated emission.
So this is being built in, however
since we are describing the drive field
by a classical field by Rabi frequency,
we are not really accounting for the number
of photons exchanged with it.
So in a way, the driving field is always
treated in the undepleted approximation.
It's a z number, but in the drive system.
But, of course, you can immediately
read from the Rabi oscillation the exchange
of excitations between the atomic system and the drive
field.
So yes, the optical Bloch equations contain that,
but not in the photon picture.
But I guess what I'm--
so if you have Rabi oscillations you can kind of guess
that every time you go down, you stimulated the emission.
In steady state, you don't have Rabi oscillations.
Can you still somehow extract the rate?

I hope the question we answer will become crystal
when we discussed quantum Monte Carlo simulations.
In quantum Monte Carlo simulation,
we have an ensemble of atoms.
And the atoms all do Rabi oscillation,
but in steady state they do it out-of-phase.
So you have atoms in your ensemble
which, at a given time, absorb, and others
emit in a stimulated way.
And the effect cancels out in steady state.

Other questions?
Yes.
So you're saying in steady state, they kind decohere.
You don't have any net change in these populations.
Do you still get the triplet lines
if you don't have a modulation of your intensity beam?

Yes, absolutely.
The Mollow triplet is a feature in steady state.
And maybe let me explain that, because it's
an interesting discussion.
What will happen is, in steady state in your ensemble,
you don't have Rabi oscillations.
But if you would look at one atom,
you see Rabi oscillations.
It's just when you average over all atoms in your ensemble,
the phase of the Rabi oscillation has averaged out.
So in other words, what would for instance, what would happen
is the following.
If you take a steady state solution,
and you ask what is the dipole moment as a function of time
in steady state, you will find that this is 0.
So you would then ask, hey where is the light emitted?
Because isn't the light emitted by a time-dependent dipole
moment?
What you really have to do is when you want to study time,
when you want to study light emission in steady state,
you can't look at expectation values,
because they are not changing as a function of time.
What you have to do is you have to look at the correlation
function.
And the correlation function sort of tells you--
let me just use it for Rabi oscillation--
if one atom is sort of in the excited state, a Rabi period
later, it would be, again, in the excited state.
So also you are in steady state, you have correlations.
Because if you look at your ensemble and see
there is a fluctuation where the atom is excited,
you will actually find the correlated fluctuation
a Rabi period later.
So in steady state, when you want to study dynamics
like the Mollow triplet, you should not
look at the solution for the dipole.
You should look for the solution of the correlation function.
And I made this cryptic remark on Wednesday
that this correlation function follows the same differential
equation as the expectation value.
Therefore, when I try to discuss for you the line
widths of the Mollow triplet, I simply
use the matrix for the block vector,
knowing that it uses the matrix, the same differential
equation, which will describe this correlation function.

But it is important here that in steady state,
the average values are 0, but we have fluctuations.
And it is the fluctuations which emit
the light, the fluctuations which emit the Mollow triplet,
and fluctuations are described by quantities like this.
So it's a little bit beyond what I want to discuss in the book,
but Atom-Photon Interaction has a wonderful chapter on that.
Other questions?

There is another important case of the optical Bloch equation,
which is the weak excitation limit, which is simple,
but I've already asked you to look at it in your homework
