What I want you to sort of, enjoy now
is, I took you last class for the Bosons.
And you should maybe see, how the fermions are different,
but we use similar concepts.
And so you may ask yourself at the end of the day,
are the fermions really so different from the bosons
when it comes to superfluity, but we're getting there.
OK so the standard assumption-- the standard--
let's make this an approximation,
we use a delta function here.
And that-- and before we transform we
go from position space to momentum space.
But now comes one important approximation.
I mean fermions are fairly complicated.
Look I mean we have products of four operators,
and we integrate over for three momenta, our initial momenta,
induce the initial momentum, the final momentum,
and the momentum transfer.
So we have an integral over three momenta.
We have to do something, this is too complicated.
And the BCS Approximation is the only focus
was in this sum of pair operators that we scatter,
or we have entered K-prime minus K-prime scatters
into K minus K. So we pretty much
say whenever we have in the interaction term two fermions,
we are only looking at pairs where center of mass momentum
is zero.
You can say it's an uncontrolled approximation,
but it's based on intuition.
So the hope is that we still capture
the essence of superfluity by doing this major simplification
of the Hamiltonian.

So now I want to show you that this Hamiltonian can
be solved in two ways.
And this really connects maybe with things
you have learned previously.
One is, we can use as a Variational Ansatz
this pair wave function, which I just constructed.
That's actually what Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer did,
but they used as a tidal wave function, the BCS wave
function with the Us and Vs, which is identical.
But then I want to show you partially now,
because of I'm feeling nostalgic about the bosons,
that you can also use a Bogoluibov
transformation, the same method we learned for the bosons.
So Variational Ansatz just means use
this BCS wave function, which I just showed you,
plug it into the Hamiltonian, and all you
do is you vary the component--
you vary the coefficients, u and v,
until you find the minimum of the energy.
And this gives you the famous BCS solution.
And this is the plain [? vanilla ?]
formalism for superconductors and fermion superfluity.
OK.
I don't have time to go into details,
but I think you've got the big picture.
But let me now just emphasize the similarities
we had with the bosons.
We have a Hamiltonian, even with the--
with this BCS approximation that we have--
we've got it over one, sum over momentum,
by focusing on the pairs zero center of mass momentum.
You still have products of four operators.
We want to get rid of it.
But now we use a mean field idea.
You know we always get rid of products of four operators
by grabbing one or two of them, and saying
we don't look at the operator we look at the expectation value,
which is the mean field.
So I want to make a mean field approximation.
But the group of four bosons was simply,
we just took the operators C-zero, zero momentum,
and replaced them with the square root of [? n0, ?]
the number of atoms in the quantum [? zed. ?] But now we
have to be a little bit more subtle.
So what we should now define is a pairing mean field.
Not an expectation value of C-zero,
but an expectation value of this creation
or annihilation operators for pass.
It's a little bit more abstract, but it follows the same logic.
So and then we do that decoupling approximation,
which I lectured about you with a mod insulator,
that whenever we have products of operators of products
of pain operators now, we take the mean value
but we neglect the product of the fluctuations.
Exactly what I've shown you before when
we described the mod insulator to super-fluid transition.
OK.
This is the pairing--
this is the pairing filled with an index K,
and eventually it's important to define a delta, the famous gap
in the BCS, when the BCS theory, which
is the sum of our pairing fields with k.
And it is this delta which plays the role of the condensate wave
function, exactly in the same way
as psi, the macroscopic wave function in [INAUDIBLE]
equation plate, this one.
So we do the same thing, we just kind of
write it down with treetop quadratic terms,
which fluctuation terms.
And the moment we have now simply bi-linear
product of operators, we do exactly the same
as we did with bosons.
We transform to a set of operators, which
is Bogoliubov transformation.
Of course, this time we want to make sure that those--

that the transforming Fermi unit operators
will want to make sure that after transformation, we
fulfill fermionic commutator, and then we
determine coefficients in such a way that cost terms cancel out.
And what you obtain now is a diagonalized Hamiltonian.
Its diagonalized.
It has a ground state energy.
And this, you now realize, this is nothing
like a harmonic oscillator.
Its across a particular gas of independent excitations,
gamma K is an excitation with energy E- K
and this means we have diagonalized the problem.
I can't do justice to the formalism.
I think the best I can do here for you
is to show how the same ideas come back
and sort of the same problem.
Also everything is now for fermions.
Mark?
Could we recall to the previous slide,
we coupled the sum of K prime separate
to molecular delta x [INAUDIBLE] over k of the C operators.
You said [INAUDIBLE].
Yeah, here.
Like in the very top line you have the sum
of K-prime for this one term.
And then on the next slide you had
delta, which is the sum over K, of the expectation value
and then times the sum.
I derived it myself because it confused me,
but I can just reassure you if you
take the original Hamiltonian, plug this into here,
and neglect the product of the small fluctuations,
you get exactly this equation.
Its really just accounting and regrouping terms.
There is no assumption, no concept involved,
it's really just plugging it in and the physics
is that we neglect the coalition of the fluctuations.
OK.
We have not solved it.
Either with a variation of Ansatz
or with the Bogoliubov transformation,
two very different ways lead to the same solution.
We have quasi particles, here.
We determine what their energies are.
Well a little bit complicated creations
to find what the cause of particle energies are.
But everything is known.
We can both throw in temperature,
[INAUDIBLE] did final temperature.
Well what happens with this Hamiltonian final temperature?
Well we just have occupation number for those
quasi-particles the thermal occupation, and we have to--
self-consistency now look what happens in the presence
of quasi-particles.
This eventually leads to an equation
for the critical temperature.
So what we see here is as a function
of the inverse scattering links.
Here we have BEC temperature, which is constant.
And when we go on the BCS side, where we no longer form around
molecules, we have this exponentially decaying
temperature for very small attraction, the transition
temperature to the super-fluid state exponentially small.
