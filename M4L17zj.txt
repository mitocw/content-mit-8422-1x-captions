Let me take this famous paper and show you
one way how polarization gradient cooling works.
Which is the most famous form of sub-Doppler cooling.
And this goes as follows.
If you have [INAUDIBLE] with two laser beams,
and the two laser beams are lin perp lin--
linear polarization perpendicular
to the other linear polarization.
So you have two laser beams with these polarization.
When these two polarizations overlap
and they have the same phase, you get light at 45 degrees.
But if these two polarization have 90 degree out of phase,
you get circularly polarized light.
So as these two laser beams counterpropagate,
you periodically go from linear polarized sigma
minus linear polarized sigma plus.
So you have spatial--
at any given point, you have a polarization
but the polarization changes.
You have a [INAUDIBLE] you would say
naively lin perp lin don't interfere--
don't form a standing wave.
Well, they do not form a standing wave in intensity.
They form a standing wave in polarization.
So now what happens is the following.
If you have a multi-level atom--
and I use this simple scheme here.
The different polarizations, linear polarization drives
pi transition, sigma plus and sigma minus
drive different transitions and those transitions
have different strengths.
So an atom here when it experiences this polarization
will just cycle.
But when it experiences the other circular polarization,
it will be optically pumped over here.
And then it cycles.
So therefore an atom, which goes from sigma plus polarization
and goes here it flies over to an area where you've
sigma minus polarization.
It will actually be pumped over.
So the atom will constantly be pumped back and forth
between those hyperfine states.
And this actually gives rise to a beautiful form of Sisyphus
cooling that the atom experiences sigma plus
light in one ground state.
It sort of climbs up the hill.
It's [INAUDIBLE] the AC Stark shift potential.
And the AC Stark shift potential because of the--
for instance, for one hyperfine state,
sigma plus drives the strongest transition.
And therefore, where we have sigma plus light
one ground state has the deepest potential.
Where we have sigma minus light, it
is the other ground state which has the deepest potential.
And so what happens is that the atom is in one hyperfine state,
it climbs up the hill, and then it's
optically pumped to the other hyperfine state.
And we have exactly the same kind of Sisyphus cooling.
I just show you pictures and you match it with what you know.
This is more complicated because this involves optical pumping
between hyperfine states.
The different hyperfine states of
different Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and such.
It's not really complicated, but more complex.
What I explained to you is how Sisyphus cooling
works in the [INAUDIBLE] atom picture just
for a two-level system.
And here you find a more subtle form of Sisyphus cooling.
But this form is more important because whenever
you operate a magnetooptic trap you
get this cooling mechanism for free.
