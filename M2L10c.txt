So let me give you one interpretation, which I really
like, and I learned that actually form Dan Kleppner when
he taught the atomic physics course at MIT
20 years ago, that was one element of it.
And I told you at the beginning that I'm actually proud that
our atomic physics course has hopefully kept the best
of the decade long tradition of teachers like [INAUDIBLE]
and Kleppner and [? Dave ?] [? Pritchard. ?] So this is now
really due to Dan Kleppner.
And I will later today actually post
Dan Kleppner's original lecture notes about this effect.
So we want to understand the Van der Waals force in a completely
different system.
And I think that helps.
We have two LC circuits.
There's L, C, C, L. And what happens
is the two capacitors are close, so there
is a stray field of one capacitor [INAUDIBLE]
the other capacitor.
So I won't go through the detailed math here,
because it's not necessary.
But what we have here is we have two coppered systems,
two coppered capacitors, and the only thing I want to use
is that the stray field of a capacitor
has a dipole characteristic.
And it decays with 1 over r cubed.
So what we have right now is each LC circuit, when
it's isolated, has a resonance frequency of omega naught.
But now, when we have two pendulums, two oscillators
which are coupled, we get two modes,
which are omega plus and minus.
And if we simply solve for two modes
and they have some coupling--
well, we get an upshift and downshift by the coupling.
But if we look more carefully at the solution for two
coupled modes, it has also a quadratic effect,
which is sometimes neglected, but it's there.
So this is in general what you will
