The solution is that the coupling is now
increasing the splitting.
The splitting between the two levels
is, again, the generalized [INAUDIBLE] frequency, which
you've seen many, many times.
But now we want to really get the wave function.
We want to get something out of the dressed atom picture.
And that's the following.
We started out with the bear states--
ground state with n plus 1, excited state with n photons.
And the 2 by 2 matrix, after the diagonalization,
is now a linear combination of those.
And it's convenient to use sine theta cosine
theta because then the states are automatically normalized.
If I introduce, the solution is now
that the angle theta is given by this equation.
That's just the solution for the 2 by 2 matrix.
And the physical picture which we have obtained
is the following if this here is the energy of the excited
state within photons.
I've just sort of drawn this as a reference parallel,
but now I want to draw it as a function of the laser
frequency.
Well, the ground state with n plus photons
has exactly the same energy on resonance,
but if the photon is more energetic, then this state,
because it has n plus 1 photons versus n photons,
if the photon is more energetic than a resonant photon,
this state has higher energy, and here it has lower energy.
In other words, we have, now, a level crossing between the two
bare states, but a level crossing with interaction
turns into an avoided crossing, and the solution
which we have just derived are the glue curves.
And if I go far away from resonance,
this behavior here, which is perturbative,
is nothing else than the AC stark shift.
