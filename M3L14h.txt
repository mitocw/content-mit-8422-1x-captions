OK, so this was more a qualitative discussion.
Let's now work more quantitatively,
and describe the Mollow triplet.
The Hamiltonian for our system is the atomic Hamiltonian
times the z Pauli matrix.
The z Pauli matrix is excited, excited minus ground,
ground state.
And because of the conservation of probability, it's 2 times
Xi, or also just mathematically, it's just that.
We have the free Hamiltonian of the radiation
field, which is a dagger a.
And then we have the coupling of a two-level system, which
is the product of the atomic dipole moment written
as sigma plus plus sigma minus, raising and lowering operator.
Just to remind us, sigma plus is e g, and sigma minus is g e.
And then we have to multiply with a plus a dagger.
If you want the atomic part, it's the dipole moment.
And this is the electric field, both written as operators.
So this is the electric field.
And if you look at the coupling term--
we've discussed it before--
you have four terms.
But in the rotating wave approximation
which we want to use here, we keep only
the two resonant terms, which is when
we raise an excitation in the atom,
we lose an excitation in the light field.
Or if we go from the excited to the ground state,
we emit a photon.
So we have two terms which form the rotating wave
approximation.
The other two terms are highly of resonant,
and can often be neglected.
So this rotating wave approximation
becomes, of course, the better the more we
go on resonant, because on one term, it's fully resonant
and the other one is very off resonant.
And in this case, we can simplify the Hamiltonian,
because the number of excitations is conserved.
The number of excitations is the number
of excitations in the photon field
plus the number of excited atoms.
So this is the operator which measures
the number of excitations.
If you [INAUDIBLE] counter-rotating term,
this operator is conserved.
So if I introduce, as usual, the detuning,
this is what my notes say seems to have the opposite sign.
I'm not sure if I made a sign error here or later,
or if I changed the definition.
Let's just move on and see how it works out.
So if you now do the rotating wave approximation,
our Hamiltonian has now, by introducing the operator in,
the number of quanta times h by omega.
However, we have multiplied the N operator
with the photon energy.
If the energy is in the atom, we have
made a mistake, which is delta.
And we call that by using the z Pauli matrix.
And then our interaction term is a dagger times sigma
minus plus a times sigma plus.
Let's now discuss what are the eigenstates
of this Hamiltonian in the simple case, when
the detuning is 0.
And we have sort of two ladders of eigenstates.
One is the ground state with n photons,
and one is the excited state with n photons, 0, 1, 2.
So we can label this by the photon number.
And the excited state, of course,
starts with a higher energy for 0 photon.
And this is the energy with one photon.
And in the case of 0 detuning, the two ladders are degenerate.
And if we introduce the interaction-- if g is now
non-0, the levels split.
And the splitting is given by g.
There's a factor of 2.
But now if we have photons in the field,
a dagger acting on the photon field gives n plus 1.
So therefore, for one photon, we have square root 2.
In general, we get an expression which is square root n plus 1.
Or to write it mathematically, if we
have strong mixing between an excited state with n photons
and a ground state with n plus 1 photons, for the case of delta
equals 0, it's just plus minus, symmetric and antisymmetric
contribution times 1 over square root of 2.
And these are now the states we label plus minus, the upper
and lower state of each manifold.
And n is the photon number in the excited state.
n plus 1 is the photon number in the ground state.
And the energy of those states is
the number of quanta, n plus 1.
But then we have the resonant splitting, g.
And because of the matrix element of a and a dagger,
we get square root n plus 1.

Now, if we use a very strong drive--
and this addresses Colin's question about depletion--
we use a laser beam, which is described by a Rabi frequency.
This is proportional to the electric field.
So we introduce the Rabi frequency,
which is given by that.
And the laser beam has so many photons
that we don't care about n plus 1 or scattering a few photons.
So we simply replace n, n plus 1, n minus 1,
whatever contains n, by a z number, which is the Rabi
frequency of the laser beam.
So this eventually means that we had two manifolds, plus, minus,
plus, minus.
Sorry, we have two states-- plus, minus.
And they are periodic when we add one photon
to the field, periodic in n.
The splitting is the Rabi frequency defined above.
And now we realize that when we have
spontaneous emission between the manifold n
minus 1 the manifold n, we have two possibilities
to emit light on resonance.
And we have, then, one possibility
to emit an upper side band, and one possibility
to emit the lower side band.

So what is called the "dressed" atom
picture is nothing else than the solution of an atom driven
by a strong monochromatic field.
The atom is dressed with photons.
And the eigenstates are no longer just atomic eigenstates.
These are dressed eigenstates of the combined atomic system
plus laser field.
So this dressed atom picture explains the Mollow triplet.

And you can immediately generalize it,
if you want, to [INAUDIBLE] detuning.
Then the superposition states plus/minus
do not have equal weight.
But it's what you've seen a million times--
diagonalization of a 2 by 2 matrix.
Colin.
Yeah, how does this explain the widths of--
It does not.
This is what I just wanted to say.
It explains the Mollow triplet, but not the line width.
