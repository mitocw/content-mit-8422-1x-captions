So therefore, if we have a box potential
and you know the ground state in a box
is just half a period of a sine function,
this is a non-interacting condensate.
This would be the macroscopic wave function in the box
potential, but if you now put in strong interactions,
the strong interactions are going
to flatten out the potential.
They flatten out the potential and or at the very last moment,
all right, now it's time to go down, because we have
to meet our boundary condition.
And the length scale, where you eventually
go down, it has a famous name the healing length,
is the length scale where the kinetic energy
due to the curvature of the wave function
is now comparable to the interaction energy.
If the system would curve down earlier
it would cost too much repulsive energy,
because the density is not kept flat.
If it would curve down to late, the enormous curvature
would mean a lot of kinetic energy.
And this is just the best compromise
between those two criteria.
So that's how you derive the healing length.
The healing links is now the length scale
over which the system is willing to meet boundary conditions
and not stay flat, as flat as possible.
Tim.
Just curious in that equation the atom is the mass of the--
like each individual--
The mass is a mass of a single atom.
A single atom.
It's not a--
I don't-- sorry, I wasn't here last class,
but the quasi-particles have the same mass?
In the Bose-Einstein condensate they are.
We don't-- we haven't changed the mass.
But we're not talking actually about quasi-particles.
We're simply, actually we are really
talking about here qualitative features
of the solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
And the Gross-Pitaevskii equation
is sort of a single particle equation for particles
of mass of the original biomass, M. It's a macroscopic wave
function, but I sometimes say it describes a wave function
of a single particle where all of the other particles
are included at the mean field level.
So therefore it is really this, the atomic mass
and not any form of collective mass here.
Well, if you would now ask how do interactions
transform the first excited state in the box potential.
Well then, it's again flat is the soon as-- as much
as possible.
But then, if you want to maintain the parity of the wave
function, then it's only close to the zero
crossing within the healing lengths
that the system says, OK, now I change sign.
So that's sort of what is inside the Gross-Piteavskii equation.
Now once you realize that, we can take it to the next level
and say, well, if we need length.
Let's say we are interested in the ground state
and we need like this boundary region
where the kinetic energy becomes important.
Maybe we can simplify the Gross-Piteavskii equation
by neglecting the kinetic energy.
If potential energy dominates by far, we can neglect that,
and then we should get a good description, which may not
be valid in the wings of the wave function,
but in most of space.
But now if you look at this equation,
it's no longer a differential equation.
It has no derivatives.
It's just something which applies to the wave function
beside itself.
And we can simply solve that.
The solution of that is the size square of the density
is nothing else than it's a constant minus the inverted
trapping potential.
So therefore, in this Thomas-Fermi approximation,
where we neglect the kinetic energy completely,
you just take your trapping potential, turn it upside down,
and then you fill it up with density
until you have accommodated the number of atoms
you want to accommodate.
And this is, of course, a number of--
not the constraint in the number of atoms
is determined by the chemical potential.
Or if you have a more complicated w-shaped potential,
the same construction, flip it over, fill it up,
gives you the condensate wave function,
the density distribution of the condensate in this potential.
I don't want to belabor it, but coming back
to the question of the small parameter.
If you look at those equations, you
can identify a parameter, which is--
this is now this small parameter or this,
the parameter in this system, which
is the important dimensionless parameter.
It depends on the number of atoms.
And it depends now on the ratio of the scattering length which
characterizes the interaction and the harmonic oscillate
length.
You can say, the harmonic oscillator length
is the ideal wave function harmonic oscillator.
So this parametrizes the importance
of kinetic energy versus scattering length parametrizes
the importance of interactions.
And all those solutions can be nicely written
as what you would have in an ideal gas and then
this parameter X.
So in typical experiments N-A, N is a million,
the scattering length's is smaller
than the oscillator length's, but it is a million.
And in this parameter X is usually large.
So therefore, I'm simply just talking about the solution.
We have the situation that the chemical potential is larger
by a power of x, then the ideal gas solution, which would just
be the ground state with it's zero point energy
in the harmonic oscillator potential.
Or the width, the size of the wave function
is larger than the ground states of the harmonic oscillator,
but only with an exponent, which is one-fifth.
Well, we can see that these are now again
somewhat improved pictures of condensates inside the trap.
For the expert, the previous picture
was dark ground imaging, this is now phase contrast imaging.
And if you take a profile, we clearly
see the condensate wave function.
And we see the thermal wings.
When we look at the size of the condensate wave function,
you realize what I just meant that the ground state wave
function, the harmonic oscillator length
is seven micron in the X direction,
but here you have 300 micron.
So this condensate is completely dominated by interactions.
And it fulfills very nice and pretty
much the whole shape, except maybe some details
in the wings, are quantitatively described
