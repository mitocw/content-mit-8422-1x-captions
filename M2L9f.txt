Finally, let me now address the question,
is everything I'm explaining to you really happening?
Is it really happening in a physical system?
Well, the first answer is I wouldn't tell you
about it if it had no reality.
So, yes, you can imagine that this
is what your atom is doing.
You can imagine that the hydrogen atoms that the Lamb
shift is permanently emitting and absorbing
photons and all sorts of weird photons
from the ground state, lower, up, and back again and such.
Yes, this is the way how we derive
some of the most precise predictions in physics, namely
QED.
However, we can represent systems
in different gauges in different representations.
And we had discussed earlier that we often
take the dipole representation for the light atom interaction
but there's also the p minus a presentation.
And if you look at the two, both the e
dot d and the a dot p intersection
are the product of something which creates and isolates
similar photons, a plus a dega.
And then the p operator or the d operator
connect the ground with the excited state.
So those matrix element would tell you
you can only emit and absorb a photon
when you go from the ground to the excited state.
However, in p minus a representation,
we also have the a square term.
And the a square term allows you,
because there is no atomic operator in front of it,
allows you to scatter two photons without changing
the quantum state of the atom.
But this does not contradict anything.
You can take either approach, and in your homework
you will actually do that when you calculate radius scattering
Thomson scattering, and you will find out
that the two approaches give identical results.
So if you now ask a philosophical question,
can an atom scatter a photon without changing its quantum
state, well, the answer to this question
is actually gauge-dependent.
But maybe to lift away some of the confusion,
one can, of course, also see the a square term is
really important and it's a simple description
of Thomson scattering.
Thomson scattering is about photons,
which have much, much more energy than the energy
difference between the calm and excited state.
So therefore, if you want to completely describe the system,
and you can, it's just more complicated,
with a dipole approximation, you have to scatter a photon.

But because the photon has so much more energy,
it's so far away from resonance, this intermediate state
has a huge energy defect.
And that means what I just explained to you,
the system wants to immediately pay back the money
to Heisenberg's bank, so it will remain in this state
only for very, very short time.
And now the other gauge tells you this very, very short time
can also be 0.
So see, it's not as dramatically different as you might assume.
But this is just something which is common
that if you have different representations,
the physics taste different, but you always
have to remind you that when you calculate an observable result,
the two different gauges must exactly agree.
So this is all I wanted to say about the dichromatic solution
for the time evolution of a quantum system.
But I want to use it now.
I think this is interesting stuff.
It's a powerful method.
And I want to illustrate to you how this method can be
