Yes?
Why did you choose the spheres to be of side--
I have the same size as the distance between them.
Well, that's always a trick.
[LAUGHTER]
You know what would happen is--
let me just go back here.
If I would choose the sphere smaller,
I would not have given the atom the whole exposure.
I have to make it at least larger
than c to make sure that the curvature of the sphere
doesn't dominate.
And what the atom sees is it sees that there is a wall.
But then you can say when I make the sphere larger than z,
then I delocalize the dipole moment.
And the bigger sphere has a big polarizability.
But the atom which was so close to the sphere
doesn't care about it.
So you would say the right choice is just when you think
either picture gets corrupted.
But that's so often what it is.
So if you think about it, it's the only choice.
Both other choices would lead to an unphysical result.
And you would immediately realize why.
In one case, it's the curvature.
In the other case, it's--
you're not really sampling the dipole of the sphere
because you're so--
you want to do a dipole field.
And if you have a dipole of size z, the field with a dipole
starts to be an approximation if you go a distance z away.

Other questions?
Yes?
Can you explain where the first term [INAUDIBLE] come from?
Last class, we had the result that the retarded van der Waals
potential is 1 over r to the 7.
But with the physical picture in mind
that the van der Waals potential at long range, which
is 1 over r to the 7, comes because a vacuum fluctuation
drive two dipoles.
And the two dipoles attract each other.
Then each dipole is alpha 1 times a vacuum field.
The other one is alpha 2 times a vacuum field.
But now for the sphere, alpha is z cube.
So therefore, three powers in the denominator cancel.
And I get z to the 4.
So you can say the alpha 2--
I absorbed-- I used the result that alpha 2 is z cubed.
And then the alpha 2 canceled with three powers
of the distance in the denominator.
Other questions?
I have a question for you now.
If you have two metal plates, what about short range and long
range?
We have swept something under the rug.
If we assume a metal plate, what is the resonant?
We had the distinction between long range and short range,
which came from the resonant radiation,
from the resonant excitation of the atom.
And when we are closer than the wavelength,
we are in short range.
If we are further than the wavelength
of the resonant transition, we are in long range.
Between an atom and the plate, well, we still
have the resonance of the atom.
But what happens when we have two plates?
There is clearly no resonance.
So therefore, there is only one power law, 1 over z cube.
But I want you to think about it for a moment
whether this is now--
whether everything is long range or everything is short range.
In other words, is the effective resonant radiation--
it's the effective wavelength of the plate lambda
equals 0 or lambda equals infinity in your opinion?

Over here.
Is the dc polarizability so that must be an [INAUDIBLE].

[INAUDIBLE] take two metal plates, the vacuum energy
between those plates, and compare it
to the vacuum energy for the same volume of free space.
Then you subtract the energies.
Compare the energy difference.
Then the high-frequency components cancel out.
So you have the low-frequency--
We will actually do exactly what you
suggest to compare vacuum energies
in the next few minutes.
It's not quite obvious.
But I want to tell you now, we have
made by assuming the metallic boundary condition,
by assuming that we have idealized metal plates which
fulfill the boundary condition, that the electric field is
0 at the surface--
that the parallel component of the [INAUDIBLE] the surface.
We've made an assumption here.
And the assumption is actually that the resonant wavelengths
goes to 0.
And the resonance frequency goes to infinity.
And the power law we obtain is actually the long distance
power law, so to speak.
And for two metal plates, there is no short distance.
I'm not sure if I can give you a simple explanation
because the boundary condition is so idealized
that you don't recognize, you don't smell
any atomic resonance anymore.
But maybe the one thing I would say
is that you set a boundary condition, metallic boundary
condition, for infinitely high frequency.
And sometimes, that would also mean
that the plasma frequency of the metal is pushed to infinity.
