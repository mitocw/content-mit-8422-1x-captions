Now, in quantum mechanics, when we
ask for the oscillator in the ground state,
we can find the zero-point energy.
And so the energy in the ground state
is 1/2 the zero-point energy in the mode plus,
in the mode minus.
The first-order coupling term, the 1 over R cube, cancels out.
But what remains is a contribution,
which is 1 over r to the 6.
So we need quantum physics.
We need-- because in classical physics,
the ground state of the LC circuit is--
nothing happens-- no charge, no current, no nothing.
This is the classical ground state.
And you would not get any effect.
So realize that this van der Waals potential
requires quantum mechanics.
And it is due to the zero-point energy
of the atomic oscillators.

Just hold the thought.
When we talk about atoms in the electromagnetic field,
we have two oscillators.
We have a harmonic oscillator, which
is a fluctuating dipole moment in each side of the atom.
But we have many, many harmonic oscillators in between,
which is electromagnetic field.
And during the course of this lecture,
I will refer to both the zero-point energy
of the atomic oscillator and the zero-point energy
of the oscillator which is electromagnetic field.
And to give you the result at the end,
I will sort of explain different effects
by the zero-point oscillation of the atoms, other effects
by the zero-point oscillation of the electromagnetic field.
But at the end of this section, which is probably
after spring break on Monday, I will actually tell you
that you have to be careful.
If you have quantum physics, you have
to use a consistent description.
And you always need that both the field and the atoms
are quantized and have zero-point fluctuations.
And when I'm telling you now that--
the van der Waals potential is due only
to zero-point fluctuations of the atomic oscillator,
there may be another way of getting the same result
by looking at the zero-point fluctuations
of the electromagnetic field.
So I just want you to take what I'm saying you.
I'm not saying you anything wrong.
But it may not be the only way of expressing it.
And I want you just to pay attention to it.
But certain effects can be simpler
described by simply looking at the atomic oscillators.
Why do we need the quantized electromagnetic field
when all we want to do is have a stray field
coupling two capacitors?
So we want to always learn about the simplest way
to understand an effect.
But then in the end, there are maybe certain subtleties.
But let's keep it simple.
So it's a zero-point energy of the two oscillators.
And maybe let me emphasize this by translating this description
what we learned from the capacitors.
Let me give you the equivalent description of the atom.
So an atom will never have in free space a spontaneous dipole
moment.
But because of zero-point oscillation,
it will have a dipole moment squared.
So what happens now is let's say at some moment,
we have a fluctuation.
One atom happens to have a fluctuation
of the dipole moment.
This creates an electric field at the position of the atom b.
So this is a fluctuating field.
The fluctuating field, because there's
a finite polarizability, induces now--
induces a dipole moment of the atom db.
I will later introduce polarizabilities,
but here it's just proportion to Eb.
So that's proportional to da over R cubed.
So now we have no longer randomly fluctuating
dipole moments with Eadb, which are out of phase--
positive and minus cancels out.
We have a dipole moment da which creates for polarizability
an aligned dipole moment db.
And for those, we have now the dipole-dipole interaction,
which is db da over R cube.
And when db changes sign, da changes sign.
So the product of them will always stay the same.
And now we find that we have an interaction.
If you look, db was 1 over R cube.
And if you factor that--
multiply that with the R cube of the dipole-dipole interaction,
we obtain in a very different way the van der Waals
potential, which is 1 over R to the 6.
So therefore, what we can take away
from that is that the 1 over R to the 6 potential
is caused by the zero-point fluctuations
of the atomic dipole moments.
