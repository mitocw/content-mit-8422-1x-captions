Let me maybe try to give you another problem.
And you should maybe figure out if those two problems
are related.
I want to ask you now something simpler.
There are not three levels involved,
there are two levels involved, but one of the levels
is broadened by kappa.
It's sort of, call it an unstable state, because it
can decay with a rate kappa, and we often
show something which is broadened.
And now, we have a matrix element
between the discrete level and the broadened state,
which I call omega.
It's a matrix element or [? RB ?] frequency.
And now, you should figure out what
is the physical picture which describes
the coupling of a discrete initial state to something
which is broadened.
Is now the transition rate, from the original state--
does the original state decay with the characteristic rate,
which is omega, or is it omega squared over kappa,
or is it none of the above?
So, coupling between two levels, very, very simple,
but one level is broadened.
