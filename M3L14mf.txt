I want to discuss simple limiting cases.
So I think you're glad to hear that we are
choosing zero thermal photons.
So therefore we assume we have a cavity in vacuum.
And therefore, we only need the Lindblad operators L1 and L2.
And we want to describe the system, which
has maximally, which has only one x, which
has maximally one excitation.
We try to keep the density matrix small.
So we only want to consider three states.
So when I say there is one excitation,
it is, of course, the state which has
no photom in the excited state.
The state [INAUDIBLE] is we have the ground
state and one photon.
And those two states are coupled by the cavity.
And since I really want to discuss the simplest
case, which has all the wonderful, which already
illustrates all the concepts want to do
is, they are accompanied by the vacuum Rabi oscillation.
And we have discussed vacuum Rabi oscillation
in part one of the course.
But it's very simple.
It's just two levels coupled.
It's a two-by-two matrix.
So this is something you are familiar with.
But now, the master equation, the Lindblad operator
bring in the third level, which is the ground
state without photons.
And this can happen in two ways.
One is spontaneous emission.
The excited state emits, but not into the cavity.
It emits to the side.
So spontaneous emission can take us down here.
Or, when the excitation is in the cavity,
we have one photon in the cavity,
this photon can leak out, and the rate for that is kappa.
And since we have talked about spontaneous emissions
so much with the optical bloch equation,
we want to discuss now the case where gamma can be neglected,
and we want to understand what happens
when the only dissipation of the system
comes by photons leaking out of the cavity.

Any questions about the system and the motivation?

So our system is now an atom with a cavity.
The environment is a vacuum.
But the process of dissipation, relaxation,
is no longer spontaneous emission.
It is the photon leaking out of the cavity.
And this realizes a different physics,
and I hope by experiencing these different physics,
you have sort of a nicer picture,
what is dissipation in an open system, and what is similar,
but what is also different with spontaneous emission.
Colin.
If you're considering only kappa,
isn't there an equivalent process and order kappa
takes you to the ground of two photons in the cavity?
Don't you have to consider that state as well?

So, wait, the question is, I restrict the Hilbert space
to maximally one excitation.
So this is how we start out.
We start with a differential equation.
Now this isn't in a thermal bath.
I thought we were assuming we had--
Oh, sorry, I've--
I first made everything complicated.
But then I said, now let's make it simple.
We assume the thermal bath is 0.
So we reduced, in a way--
yes, I told you, here are four Lindblad operators,
and you can describe everything you want.
But then I said, hey, two of them become 0,
because we eliminate the thermal bath.
And now I make the approximation that spontaneous emission
is negligible.
And now we are back to the situation,
which is nice for classroom discussion we've only one term
left.
And this is leaking out of the [INAUDIBLE] of the cavity.
So I will show to you what happens.
But ultimately, when we make the cavity better and better
and kappa smaller and smaller, I will see, wait a moment.
We now have to take that our solution is
consistent with our assumption that spontaneous emission can
be neglected.
So that's sort of what you want to do.
OK, so what we want to do is we want to look
for the dynamics of the system.
We start out in state one.
So we inject one excited atom into the cavity.
And what we want to learn now is--
and it has a lot of interesting physics in it--
what will happen as a function of this new dissipation kappa?
Well, qualitatively, it should be pretty clear.
If kappa is 0, we have vacuum Rabi oscillation
between state 1 and state 2.
If you then put a little bit kappa into the system,
you have Rabi oscillation, but they're getting damp.
And, like in any oscillator, if you crank up the damping,
you go into an over-damp regime.
So this is exactly what the equations give us.
Rabi oscillation, damped Rabi oscillation,
and then, over-damped regime.
And actually, the most interesting regime for us
will be the over-damp regime.
That's something we haven't encountered.
But let me just, before we go there, write down
the master equation for you.
So without the photon leaking out of the cavity,
we have the following terms.
Without the photon leaking out of the cavity, of course,
state 3 is not involved.
We simply have Rabi oscillation between state 1 and state 2.
And this is actually also like the optical bloch creation
without damping.
It's simply the Jaynes-Cummings model minus--

that's this.
And for the coherences, we get omega not rho, 1, 1
minus rho 2, 2.
But now we put in the terms with kappa.
The state, which is the state 2, which
is the ground state with the photon,
has now a damping term, because the photon can leak out.
We get, of course, an equation for the ground state.
The population, the photon leaks out.
And we populate state free.
And the damping also effects the coherencies.
And the form of the master equation, the Lindblad form,
