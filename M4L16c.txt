What we need now is the solution for the dipole moment.
Because it is the dipole moment, which
is responsible for the mechanical forces.
The dipole operator is, of course,
n, the non-diagonal matrix elements, the coherency's
of the density matrix.
So all we want to take now, from the previous unit,
the expectation value of the dipole moment,
which is nothing else than the trace
of the statistical operator, is the operator
of the dipole moment.

At this point, just to guide you through,
we go from the lab frame, from the density matrix
in the lab frame to the density matrix in the rotating frame.
And this is when the laser frequency appears
as e to the i omega L t.
And therefore, we want to describe things
in the lab frame, if we use the u and v
part of the optical block vector obtained in the rotating frame.
In the lab frame, everything all states at the laser frequency.
If you drive an atom, if you drive an harmonic oscillator
with a laser frequency, the harmonic oscillator responds--
it delays a frequency, not at the atomic frequency
we discussed that a while ago.
So therefore, the dipole moment oscillates
at the laser frequency.
And the two components u and v, since our laser field
was parametrized by definition, epsilon0 times cosine omega t.
You We have now nicely separated with the optical block vector,
the in phase part of the dipole moment
and the in quadrature phase of the dipole moment.

If you want to--
if you didn't pay attention to what I said in the last five
minutes, that's OK.
You can just start here saying the expectation
value of the dipole moment oscillates
with a laser frequency.
And as for any harmonic oscillator or harmonic
oscillator type system, there is one component which is in-phase
and one component which is in quadrature.
