So we have the reactive force.
The reactive force is written here
by just-- what have we done?
Well, you'll remember the alpha vector was the gradient
of the Rabi frequency.
And we have to multiply with the u
component of the steady-state solution of the optical Bloch
equation.
Here it is, just put together.

It's a nice expression.
There are two things you should know about it.
The first one is that you can actually
write this force exactly as the gradient of a potential.

So there is a dipole potential.
And it is exactly this dipole potential
which is used as a trapping potential when
you have dipole traps.

Probably 99% of you use dipole traps
in the limit, where the detuning is large.
And then the logarithm of 1 plus x simply becomes x,
and you have the simple expression you are using.
But in a way, this is remarkable.
The dipole force can be derived from a potential,
even if the detuning is small and you
have a hell of a lot of spontaneous scattering, which
is usually not regarded as being due to conservative potential.
So this expression, that the reactive force
is a gradient of a potential, even applies to a situation
where gamma spontaneous scattering plays a big role.
And you're not simply in--
and this is what this last term is-- in the perturbative limit
of the AC Stark Effect.
That's number one you should know about this expression.
The second thing is if you look at this expression,
the question is, what is the maximum reactive force?
We talked about the maximum spontaneous or dissipative
force, which is h bar k, the momentum of a photon,
times gamma over 2.
What is the maximum force you can get out
of the reactive force?
Well, of course if you want a lot of force,
you want to use a lot of laser power.
Therefore, you want to use high Rabi frequency.
And now if you want to use your laser power wisely,
the question is, how should you pick the detuning?
And you realize if you pick the detuning small,
there is a pre-factor which goes to 0.
But if you pick your detuning extremely large,
the denominator kills you.
And if you analyze it and/or stare
at this expression for more than a second,
you realize that the optimum detuning
is when the detuning is on the order of the Rabi frequency.
And if you plug that in, you'll find that
under those optimum conditions, the reactive force
can be written, again, as the momentum of a photon.
It must be.
The momentum of the photon is the unit
of force, the quantum of force, which has to appear.
But now the frequency is not gamma,
but it is the Rabi frequency.
So the picture you should sort of have
is that under those situations, just
assume the standing wave consists
of two traveling waves, and the atom is Rabi flopping.
But it is Rabi flopping in a way that it goes up
by taking a photon from one laser beam,
and then it goes down by emitting the photon
into the other laser beam.
So viewing each Rabi flop cycle, it
exchanges the momentum 2 h bar k with the electromagnetic field.
So therefore, the reactive force, the stimulated force,
never saturates if you increase the Rabi frequency, depending,
of course, on your detuning, but if you choose the detuning
correctly, you can get a force which is just
