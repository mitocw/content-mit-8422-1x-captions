In other words, it is now possible
using Feshbach resonances.
I'm just missing color so those dots should be red.
Red is much nicer.

Just imagine some of the black is red.
In other words, by using a magnetic field,
we can go from strongly bound pairs which
form a Bose-Einstein condensate to weakly bound pairs which
resemble Cooper pairs of electrons in superconductors.
This is the physics of the BEC-BCS crossover,
and in the middle of it we find a new form of superfluidity
which has not really been realized before.
Namely, you can see these are molecules
which are too big to be called molecules,
or these are Cooper pairs which are too small to be
called Cooper pairs.
It's really pairs which sort of elbow each other.
They just fill all the space.
The pairs are exactly as large as the F between atoms.
