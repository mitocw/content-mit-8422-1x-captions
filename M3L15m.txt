Let me come back to the special case of spontaneous emission.
In that case, we have only one jump operator,
which is sigma minus.
And the normalization is the square root of gamma.
And that actually means that our quantum trajectory,
ground state, excited state is very simple.
If you start with a system 100% in the excited state,
it's very trivial what happens.
Nothing happens.
But if then the jump occurs, the particle
is in the ground state.
And nothing happens then until infinite time.
You then have to start the next trajectory,
you start in the excited state.
And this time, by chance of the random number generator,
the jump happens later.
Another time, the jump happens earlier.
And what you then have to do is you
have to average over all those realizations
what is the probability for the particle
to be in the excited state?
And this is now your estimator for the excited state diagonal
matrix element of the density matrix.

And if you've written your code correctly,
you will find that you get a wonderful exponential decay
exactly as you have expected.
