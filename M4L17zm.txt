So I've told you about Sub-Doppler cooling,
sub-recoil cooling, but what really
got atomic physicists to nanokelvin temperature
were two other techniques-- laser cooling was used
as pre-cooling, but then the final trapping and cooling
was done by magnetic trapping and evaporative cooling.
So I want to give you now a quick overview
of magnetic trapping and evaporative cooling.
So I think any discussions of magnetic trapping
starts with a theorem.
A theorem which tells you that not everything is
possible you would like to do.
And this is the following--
that-- if you have a region without charges and currents--
without-- so you are in empty space.
And what this theorem says--
in empty space, you cannot have a local maximum
of your electric and magnetic field.
So if you take the strengths of the electric field
or the strengths of the magnetic field,
you cannot have a maximum.
You can only have a minimum.
Well, and this is important when it comes to magnetic traps.
Depending on the magnetic moment--
spin up, spin down--
we could trap-- we could create a trapping potential
around a maximum of the magnetic field
or the trapping potential around a minimum
of the magnetic field.
You want to be sort of at a minimum of the potential,
but if you have a minus sign, you
may want to be at the maximum of a magnetic field.
But Wing's theorem says that only one of them is possible.
The proof really goes in two lines.
You really show if you assume that there
is a maximum that would mean that,
if you add a field to it--
you add a field and, no matter in which direction
you add a field, the total field strengths become smaller.

But that requires a violation of the Laplace equation.
I don't think-- it's easier for you--
you can probably read it at home.
But you simply assume you have the situation.
So you add-- and you show you have
an incremental field, delta e.
This field, delta e--
you have-- you are at the maximum an electric field
and then delta e over r is the small difference
of the electric field.
And you can show that this expression is only negative.
That means you have a maximum of the electric field--
when the electric field would not
fulfill the Laplace equation.
So the gist of the argument is the following.
Each component of the electric and magnetic field
fulfills the Laplace equation.
And the Laplace equation--
I don't know if-- you've probably heard about it.
If something fulfills the Laplace equation,
it says, at any given point, the function
which fulfill the Laplace equation
is equal to the average of the function--
averaged over a small sphere around it.
And that means if something fulfills the Laplace equation,
you cannot have a local maximum or local minimum,
because if the value here equals the average, that would mean,
in one direction, the value gets higher.
In the other direction, the value gets lower.
So if something fulfills the Laplace equation,
you cannot have a local maximum or local minimum.
But now we are not asking for maximum or minimum
in one component of the electric or magnetic field.
We ask for a maximum or minimum in the total value--
or the square-- of the electric field.
But then you show--
when you assume that you have a maximum,
the field points along the z direction,
that then the z component of the field cannot fulfill
the Laplace equation.
