And now I want to give you the exact description
for one typical example of a slowing technique.
And a lot of the results we find in chirped slowing
apply to other slowing techniques.
I know I've taught it several times,
and there is the conceptional point
that you can only describe chirped slowing well
when you go to the decelerating frame of the atoms.
You want to describe it in the frame of the atoms which are
continuously being decelerated.
So the way how I can introduce it is the following.
I take the maximum.
I take the spontaneous light force.
This is exactly the expression we
have discussed several times.
And now I'm saying we decide that we
want to decelerate atoms with a deceleration a, which
is negative because we slow them down.
Of course, if you pick a too large that it would require
more than the maximum spontaneous light force,
you will not find a solution.
But let's simply assume we want to decelerate atoms
with a deceleration a.
Well, what happens is this deceleration a
requires a certain force.
If the intensity of the laser would provide more force
on resonance, then it's not going to work,
because we want to decelerate the atoms
like this deceleration.
So therefore, the atoms, if they are decelerated,
have to be at a detuning delta prime in such a way
that the spontaneous light force is exactly
providing the acceleration we decided
we want to have for our atoms.
In other words, this detuning, in the frame of the atom,
the atoms are on resonance when the light force is exactly
providing the force to give you the acceleration a.
But if you have more laser power than absolutely necessary,
in the frame of the atoms, the atoms
have to be detuned in such a way that the force
with the detuning is exactly providing
the acceleration we want.

So that's the easiest way to explain it.
We have to set the stage.
We have to introduce this nominal detuning.
OK, so you can say that this detuning is just a definition.
And now we want to describe the slowing process.
So we have said we want to start with atoms
at an initial velocity, which will actually cancel out
in a moment.
But let's do it in a systematic way.
And afterwards, we want the velocity
to decrease linearly in time.

I simply defined this parameter, delta prime,
to be a solution of this equation.
So this is a well-defined quantity.
And the laser detuning, which I program my laser
to change its detuning as a function of time,
is now this nominal detuning minus a Doppler shift
due to the velocity of the atoms.
I'm really solving the problem backwards for you.
I first decide what should be the velocity
trajectory of the atoms.
How should the atoms slow down?
And then I define what is the detuning which
will result in that?
That's the easier way to understand it.
Of course, if you pick this detuning,
the atoms will exactly do that.

OK, but now what we are doing is the following.
This is the acceleration, and the velocity
we want the to have, but there may
be some atoms in the beam which do not have this velocity.
They deviate from this velocity with v prime.
So the goal of cooling would now to reduce v prime
to zero to make all the atoms follow the trajectory we
have designed for them.

OK, many words, many definitions.
Now we can simply substitute what
we have defined into the equation,
and we get a wonderful result. So we take equation 1, which
was the equation for the light force,
and we put all those definitions,
which I went to great lengths to explain to you, into it,
and we get this result. It's just that the detuning has
been expressed by delta prime and the velocity
by this difference, velocity v prime.
It's pure mathematical substitution.
But now comes the important point.
That we want to describe everything now
in the decelerating frame.
The atoms are meant to decelerate with a deceleration
a.
And you know from classical mechanics,
if you describe something decelerating frame,
you have to add a fictitious force.
This fictitious force since the acceleration is constant,
is a constant force.

But I'm expressing it now by the other parameters.
We've chosen our acceleration.
We've chosen the detuning, delta prime.
I mean, everything is connected.
And this is just a way to use the correct, the most
easiest units, or the correct parametrization
for this constant force.

And the important thing for you is this equation is exact.
It's exact for an arbitrary velocity v prime of the atoms.
So let me just summarize.
I've taken the spontaneous light force.
I've given you a bunch of definitions.
What delta prime is.
That's how you program your laser.
But then in the decelerating frame,
we need a fictitious force.
And this is nothing else than a mathematically exact rewrite
of the spontaneous light force in a decelerating frame.
But now what happens is we had a light force.
Because we assumed the laser is counter-propagating
there's a minus sign.
The fictitious force has a plus sign.
And that means that we can--
and if v prime is zero, the force is zero.
So we can now make a Taylor expansion for small v prime.
So we have again a viscous force, a friction force,
and it turns out that this friction coefficient for beam
deceleration is exactly 1/2 what we got before for molasses.
But that's clear we have one laser beam, whereas in molasses
we had two laser beams.
If you ask, what is the heating?
Well, if you have one laser beam, and now two laser beam,
the heating described by the momentum diffusion coefficient
is also just 1/2.
One beam heats exactly 1/2 of what we got for two beams.
And therefore, the temperature which
characterizes the width of the velocity distribution
in the frame of the decelerating atoms
is exactly the Doppler temperature we had before,
because the two factors of 1/2 cancel.
So now I have given you-- and I hope you take some pleasure
in it--
an example where the laser cooling for two-level system
is exactly described.
There's only a single beam, and the Doppler limit
is the exact solution.
I've not made any approximation other
than assuming I have a two-level system for which
the spontaneous light force has the expression we have derived.

I know, even with my explanation,
you have to read through it once or twice, because I
made a few substitutions, and you really
have to digest them at your own pace.
So let me give you a summary of what we have done graphically.
One laser beam scatters light.
And it is this [? Laurentian. ?] And it's a negative
[? Laurentian ?] because we have a counter-propagating beam.
We push the atoms into the negative direction.
They fly in the positive direction.
But by chirping the laser, by going
into the decelerating frame, the force doesn't go to zero.
I had to add an offset.
And this offset is a fictitious force
due to the transformation of the decelerating frame.
And now you realize that this force,
and it is the correct force in the decelerating frame,
has two zero crossings.
One is a stable point, and one is an unstable point.
And the stable point says, if an atom happens to be too fast,
it gets a correcting force, and this is like a lock point.
There is a stable lock point.
All the atoms which did not have the correct velocity we wanted
them to have, they are sucked into this lock point,
and eventually will pile up at a huge peak
at this nominal velocity.
And the width of this peak is simply
described by the Doppler limit.
Before I take your question, let me show you
what happens in the two frames.

This is v prime.
This is the velocity in the decelerating frame.
And let's say our initial velocity is this.
So what happens now is all the atoms within,
the atoms are decelerated towards v prime equals zero.
The friction force puts them to v prime equals zero.
But since we are in a decelerating frame,
in the absence of the laser, the whole Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution is just shifted, not
because the velocity of the atoms change,
because we are in a decelerating frame
and we are accelerating away from the atoms.
And what I just described for you is the following.
That at v prime equals zero, we have our friction force.
And the atomic distribution in this frame
is now pushed through.
And everything which goes through this resonant region
is collected.
And you have a peak which is piling up
at v prime equals zero.

Probably it's easier, but mathematically I
needed the decelerating frame, if you
use the following picture.
And just think of this beam slowing
I explained to you, if you just switch on a laser hear,
you would just burn a hole into the velocity distribution
and pile up the atoms.
But now you sweep, and when you sweep, you take the peak,
push it further.
It gets a bigger peak here.
Push it further.
So eventually what you're doing is
by chirping the laser in the correct way,
with the correct laser power and all that,
you are just pushing the atoms all out.
And eventually, they are piled up
in a narrow distribution, which is
defined by the time when you just switch off your laser
beam.
So one chirp of the laser from an initial detuning in the lab
frame to a final detuning in the lab frame
will just sweep out the whole Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.
And if you suddenly switch off the laser,
you have frozen in a velocity distribution which is exactly
described by the Doppler limit.

So what is easier to understand?
Molasses with two beams, or beam slowing with a single beam?
I think molasses is easier, because everything
happens in the lab frame.
But think about it.
It's a nice example for which no approximations have to be made.
Questions?

Yes, Nancy.
It's not really obvious me how in this mathematics
we are choosing a time-dependent detuning as opposed
to a time-dependent acceleration, deceleration.

The way how I presented it logically,
we said we want a certain acceleration to happen,
and then we provide our laser that kv is the Doppler shift.
ka is how the Doppler shift changes as a function of time.
And we chirp our laser exactly in frequency
with a chirp which is ka.
So in other words, I started to define constant a, and that
would require that the laser is now chirped in a linear way.
I could have started the other way around and said,
hey, let's assume we chirp the laser in a linear way,
and then we do the corresponding substitutions,
and the result would be the same.
No, actually, if we did not want to have a detuning which
was time-dependent, would we have gotten--
we still have a force.
And that force would have been just changing the terms.
Well, then it's more complicated.
Yeah, then you have to integrate a differential equation,
but what happened is the following.
What I've done is by defining the acceleration and then
the chirp, I have this situation that in the reference
frame of the decelerating atoms, the detuning is constant.
So usually you go to a decelerating frame
if something else simplifies and what simplifies
is that in the frame of the atom,
the laser detuning is constant.
So you can also say the frame in which the atoms decelerate is
exactly the frame in which the chirp has disappeared,
because the decelerating frame compensates
a chirp with a linearly varying, time varying Doppler shift.

But the physics, I think, is really--
the moment you have a force which has a zero crossing,
it's a lock point.
You determine the slope, and alpha
together with the momentum diffusion gives you
the final temperature.
So I hope you enjoy that it's actually
the same physics, exactly the same physics we discussed
with some approximation for molasses.
