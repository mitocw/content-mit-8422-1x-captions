Let me just emphasize it again.
And giving you also an example in the reference.
A zero measurement, a zero measurement
modifies the wavefront.
You can also put it like this.
What the wave function is, is the best knowledge
you have about this system.
The wave function is a way to predict what happens next.
And it's the most precise way to predict it.
More accurate predictions than the wave function allows cannot
be made because of Heisenberg's uncertainty relation.
But what happens is if you have a 50/50%
superposition of [? count ?] in excited state
and the system is not immediate, then you would see initially
my guess was half of the atoms are excited, half of the atoms
are in the ground state.
But if none of them has decayed for a while, you would say,
I revised my estimate now.
Now I have to assume that more are in the ground state
because having not decayed means there is a higher probability
that the system has actually--
is in the current state to begin with.
So this is how this way of dealing with the wave function
automatically adjusts for the knowledge you
have gained about this system.
Let me give you another example of its home this message.
And I take it from a pedagogical paper form
Dickey from American Journal of Physics 49, 926 (1981).
And what he discussed is the following.
You have a box and of originally your atomic wave function
is completely organized.
You were both Einstein condensate
if you want in this box.
Or let's just this one atom to be more precise
and it's completely de-localized.
But now, you focus a laser beam into the system.
And the laser beam would ionize your atom
and you could count the ion with 100% probability.
And for a short moment, you flash on the laser
and the result is yes, you count.
You get a count.
In that moment you would see, my wave function
is more localized.
I revise my estimate.

Well, maybe I shouldn't say ionized.
If it's ionized, you destroy the atom.
Let's just you observe luminescence so the atom is
still alive.
But now you have to say the atom is localized in that region.
However, if you don't observe anything,
you would say, well, now it's actually more probable
that the atom is outside.
Because if it had been in the laser beam
with a certain probability I would have detected a photon.
But the non-detection of a photon
means that I revise my estimate.
And I say, it's much more probable
that the atom is outside the laser beam
than inside the laser beam.
So this, here, is exactly how a non-observation
of anything, a zero measurement, modifies your wave function.
And the formula-ism to incorporate that
is what we have discussed before.
Yes, Cody?
Your arguments here so far are the same way as a-- inside
the waveform we have this entire capacital probability
and we're updating or resetting the probability?
You haven't included anything about the relative
between these two.
I want to do that now.
I mean this is sort of just to address the basic concepts
about what does a measurement mean, what does a zero
measurement mean.
But now I want to write down everything for you
in amplitudes.
We want to do exactly the time evolution of this system.
Nancy?
Yes, but if you do not [INAUDIBLE] that
is, then we should not just apply [INAUDIBLE].

Well, if your particle-- if your system
is not in an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian,
it doesn't have a sharp energy.
And that would mean that when you measure the energy now,
you have fluctuations.
Sometimes you measure higher, sometimes you measure lower.
It's only when you are in an eigenstate
that you measure a sharp value.
And therefore you know from the beginning,
that you will measure an [INAUDIBLE] motion.
And sometimes you measure higher and sometimes
you measure lower than the average value.
There's nothing wrong about it, but your question
is a very good one.
You should-- I mean, those examples
are really on the one hand they are trivial,
but on the other hand it's very profound
what they tell us about [INAUDIBLE] physics
and how to apply conservation laws in such.
