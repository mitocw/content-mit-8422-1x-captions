And just to remind you where we are,
we are describing interaction between the electromagnetic
field and atoms.
And we had formulated an exact approach
using the time evolution operators and diagrams.
And well, I think we understood what
it means when atoms in the ground state
emit photons, which are virtually absorbed
and all that.
So we figured out what is really inside this formalism
and what are the processes.
What we want to continue discussing today
is one problem, which you often have with such approaches.
And this is the problem of resonance.
If you have a perturbative treatment,
even if you carry it to infinite order,
you have formally divergencies if you
have resonant interaction because the ground state
and the photon has exactly the same energy
as the excited state.
And that means, if you write down
the perturbative expension, you have
a zero in the denominator of divergence.
And I reminded you that in a phenomenological way,
you have seen that this problem can
be fixed by adding an imaginary part to the energy level--
just saying well, the excited state
couples by spontaneous emission to the radiation field,
and the level has widths.
Well but you know, sometimes putting imaginary part
into Schrodinger's equation means
it's no longer unitary time evolution.
It has its problem.
But any way, we want to now look deeper into it.
I want to show you what are the tools
to treat those infinities, those divergencies,
in a consistent and a systematic way.
And one hint how we have to do with it comes
by simply taking this energy denominator
and expanding it in gamma--
simply a Taylor expansion in gamma.
And then we realize--
I mean, gamma is often calculated in second order
from this Golden Rule.
But since we have here all orders n,
that tells us that doing something here
probably means infinite orders a perturbation series.
And that's what I want to show you today.
I want to show you that I can go beyond this result,
but I can reproduce this result by going to infinite order
in perturbation theory.
And that means to sum up an infinite number of diagrams.
Who of you has actually seen those kind
of diagrammatic tricks and summation?
A few.
OK.
So it's maybe nice to see it again.
But for those who haven't seen it,
welcome to the magic of diagrams.
I learned it from those examples.
And I really like it.
It's a really elegant way to combine equations
with graphical manipulations.
