However, the magneto-optic trap is not so simple.
I would actually say nobody fully
understands the magneto-optic trap,
because we have a multi-level structure.
We don't have just one count level.
A sodium [INAUDIBLE] atom has--

f equals one and f equals two--
has eight different hyperfine levels.
So there is not one level, and we can excite the atoms,
there are eight different levels.
And those laser beams do optical pumping
among those eight levels.
And you have to solve eight equation
for eight different levels.
And the amazing thing is it still works.
It still works pretty much at least qualitatively as well
as I just described to you.
So it's a combination of optical pumping and Zeeman shifts.
It even works better than advertised,
because as I will tell you in the next few weeks
you can reach temperatures because
of the multi-level structure.
You reach temperatures which are much colder than the Doppler
limit.
It's called polarization gradient cooling.
It's just as if you have laser beams
and you have atoms with hyperfine structure,
they are colder than the Doppler limit.
First nobody understood it, and then
Bill Phillips figured it out, and that he figured out
why atoms get colder.
This was at least the main point emphasized by the Nobel
Committee when he got the Nobel Prize for laser cooling.
Of course, he had already invented Zeeman slowing before,
so he had a few other things under his belt.
But anyway, the fact that the MOT works
even better than advertised is another miracle.
And this is related to the hyperfine structure.
And finally, the fact that you can simply extend it
to three dimension is, I said, the first or second
maybe the third miracle, it also works,
because when you look at the field of two
coils, this so-called anti-Helmholtz field,
there are some directions where the magnetic field is not
just-- where the direction of the magnetic field
is not radially outward.
This is a much more complicated magnetic field.
It goes outward here, outward here,
but in between the quadrupolar field it sort of curves.
There are some directions where the magnetic field is not
radial.
And you would say, hey, the one dimensional
scheme is [INAUDIBLE] set.
Actually, before the magneto-optic trap
was demonstrated, Dave Pritchard's student, Eric Robb,
did calculations on what happens in these diagonal directions,
which have no resemblance to the one dimensional scale.
The solution is in those directions the trapping form is
a little bit weaker, but the big picture is it doesn't matter.
So there was an idea conceived in one dimension
for a simple atom structure, and this idea worked even better
for real atoms and in three dimensions.
OK, in your homework assignment you
will put in some numbers, which show
what happens if you take a vapor, an alkaline vapor
at a very low density of 10 to the 8 per cubic centimeter,
pressure of typically 10 to the minus 8 Tor
and you arrange six laser beams around it.
Well, those laser beams have a restoring force in velocity
that means they cool and increase the phase space
density of your sample by eight orders of magnitude.
Those laser beams have also a restoring force
in the spatial dimension.
Therefore, you get a cloud which has three orders
of magnitude higher density.

So the temperature goes down by eight orders
of magnitude, which means the phase space density is enhanced
by 12 orders of magnitude.
So if you're talking about the goal of reaching
Bose-Einstein condensation, which requires a phase space
density of one, just having a dilute vapor
and these six laser beams with a little bit of magnetic field
increases your phase space density
by 15 orders of magnitude.
So this is why molasses and [INAUDIBLE]
were real milestones.
Now with 15 orders of magnitude, you
are just four or five orders of magnitude
away from Bose-Einstein condensation.
And we will discuss in a week and a half
what techniques were needed to bridge
the gap between those temperatures
and densities [INAUDIBLE] the degeneracy of gases.

So anyway, so that's the story of the magneto-optic trap.
So I'm also telling you that because I'm
proud that a lot of the pioneering work in this regard
happened at MIT.
It was Dave Pritchard who realized that the Optical
Earnshaw theorem can be circumvented,
and it was him in collaboration with Steve Chu
that they together realized the first magneto-optic trap.
And this was in 1987.
