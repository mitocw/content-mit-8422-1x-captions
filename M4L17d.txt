So what I've shown here is, and this
is the situation we want to focus on for a while,
assume you focus a laser beam.
Then plot it as a function of position.
The atom is outside the laser beam.
It goes into the laser beam, where it experiences
the electromagnetic field.
And if it goes further, it has crossed the laser beam,
and is out of the laser beam again.
OK, so what happens is, the splitting between the two
dressed energy levels is the generalized Rabi frequency.
And this is outside the laser beam, simply the detuning.
But then when the laser beam is on,
the generalized Rabi frequency gets larger.
We have a larger splitting between the dressed energy
levels, and so on.
What is also important is that if the laser is
red detuned, which is here, the lower dressed level correlates,
corresponds, to the ground state,
whereas for blue detuning, the ground
state in this limit, the ground state
correlates with the upper dressed level.
So it's important.
So therefore, an atom in this situation--
because atom's are always more in the ground state than
in the excited state--
an atom will have more population
in the upper dressed level.
And here, it will have more population in the lower dressed
level.
OK, so what we want to do now is we
want to rewrite the stimulated light force or the dipole force
as--
we want to express it through the forces acting
on the dressed atom level.
Well, I told you that we have a splitting of the dressed energy
levels by the generalized Rabi frequency.
So therefore, if I just cover that,
the energy level of the two dressed
levels is h bar over 2 plus/minus the generalized Rabi
frequency.
And the force, if an atom is in one of the dressed levels
is simply the gradient of that.
So therefore, we have the picture
that the two dressed energy levels--
the atoms in those two dressed levels--
always experience opposite forces.

Then an expression for the net force
is that the average dipole force is the force in dressed level 1
times the probability that the atom is in dressed
level 1, and the same for 2.
And if we sum it up, we get exactly the expression
we have derived earlier for the stimulated light force.
But let's just sort of look at it in the following picture.
If we are blue detuned, and let's assume
we're not saturating the transition,
so therefore, the atom will be mainly in the ground state.
So you have more population in that state.
But if the laser power is 0, we have 100% population here.
But when the atom moves into the laser beam,
there is a superposition of ground and excited state.
But it also means there's a superposition of upper
and lower dressed level.
But we have always, of course, more population
in the dressed level which connects to the ground state,
because an atom will--

it also comes out of the solution, but it's natural.
Just assume you make the laser beam weak.
You start in the ground state and everything
is sort of connected.
The ground state is simply dressed by a small excited
state contribution.
So that explains it, why, for blue detuned light,
the physics is mainly in the upper dressed level.
And we see the repulsive dipole force of a blue detuned laser,
whereas for red detuned light, the dominant population
is in the lower dressed level.
And we have an attractive force.
Well, that's simple.
We haven't gained so much, but we'll see.
We can now rapidly gain insight by taking it to the next level.
Let me first mention a trivial example.
And this is when we are on resonance.
When we are on resonance, we have equal population
in the two dressed states.
They are resonantly mixed.
And therefore, if the population in the two
dressed states is the same, but the atoms experience
opposite forces, that means the dipole force average out to 0.

In a few minutes, I want to calculate for you
what the heating is.
The dipole force is 0.
But you know the atom in this radiative cascade
is making transitions between upper and lower dressed level.
So what does it mean for the atom?
When it is in one dressed level, it experiences a force
from this side.
If the atom is in the other dressed level,
it experiences a force from that side.
So the atom is actually subject to an average force,
which is 0.
But if you take this picture literally, and you can,
the atom is really whacked left, right, left, right, left,
right.
And there is fluctuations.
And we can use those fluctuating forces to immediately calculate
what is the heating.
The force average is 0, but the fluctuations of the force
cause heating.
So that's immediately the next step of physical insight
