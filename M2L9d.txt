Then let me just spend a few minutes
on connecting what we have done with standard first and
second-order perturbation theory.
I want to throw a few definitions at you, S-matrix,
T-matrix.
But I'm not really going into any details.
I just wanted to wrap up the perturbative treatment
by connecting it with the standard first and second-order
perturbation theory.
But after that, in a few minutes,
I want to have a discussion about the nature
of intermediate and so-called virtual state,
and then talk about the interaction [? v ?]
whether it's a d dot e or the p minus e interaction.
OK.
So far I've presented the formalism
that we start at an initial time and end at a final time.
But usually these are microscopic times.
And in the experiment, we observe
a system for macroscopic time.
So for that purpose, we usually go to the limit
that initial and final times are infinitely apart.

And that actually means we have energy conservation.
The initial and final energy has to be the same.
And that can be, for instance, if we restrict ourselves
to second order.
Remember, we had all those propagators e
to the i energy over h par times t.
And when we integrate it over long times,
it will just average out to zero unless the initial and final
energy are the same.
And technically, you have seen that in under [INAUDIBLE]
derivation second-order perturbation theory,
you integrate the exponential function.
And eventually, for a sufficiently long time,
capital T-- capital T is the difference between initial
and final times--
it approaches a delta function.
So that's how energy conservation comes in.
So the fact that we have energy conservation
is then used to define S and T matrix.
The transition amplitude from the initial to the final state,
what we have just calculated and discussed,
is called the S-matrix, just how it is called.

In first order, of course, the time evolution
is the unitary matrix.
So therefore we get a conical delta.
And then we discussed that in the limit of large times
we have a delta function.
So therefore, if we take the S-matrix, which
is the transition amplitudes we have calculated,
and take out of the S-matrix the unity matrix
and factor out the delta function, then what is left
is the so-called T-matrix.

When we talk about transition amplitude, transition
probabilities, we are asking what
is the probability that the system has
gone from an initial state--
maybe the excited state to the ground state
for spontaneous emission, where probability is an amplitude
squared.
So we take the matrix element of the S-matrix and square it.
And from the line above, this is now
involving the matrix element of the T-matrix squared.

There's a delta function which becomes
a delta function squared.
But if we integrate over all the final states--
I mean a delta function is always
requiring that you do some integration later, otherwise
the delta function doesn't make sense--
the delta function squared.
You can actually explicitly see that from the sin function
above, the delta function squared just
turns into the time T.
So therefore, if we divide the probability by the time,
we have our transition probability.
We have our transition rate.
And what we obtain is the second-order expression
for the transition rate, which is essentially
from [INAUDIBLE].
