Now, talking about electric and magnetic forces.
You may think it's a trick question,
but it's rather subtle.
All optical forces were derived from the electric dipole
Hamiltonian d dot e.
This is what we use as a starting point
for light forces.
So my question is, what about the Lorentz force?
The Lorentz force comes from the magnetic part
of the electromagnetic field.
Now, is there a Lorentz force on the atoms?
And if yes, does it contribute to the light forces?
Or is it negligibly small?

Actually, the question I'm asking you,
I don't think it's addressed in any textbook.
And I think you can go to conferences
and ask some of your colleagues.
You may get a wide range of answers.
So but anyway, has anybody of you thought about it?
Is there a Lorentz force on neutral atoms?
If no, we are done.
If yes, does it contribute?
Is it negligible?
Or is it even dominant?
