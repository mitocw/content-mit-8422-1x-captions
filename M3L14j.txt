Now, I want to talk conclusions.
Our goal is to understand the spectrum
in the line widths of the Mollow triplet of the emitted light.
So I have to make the connection.
How do I make the connection from the Bloch vector
to immediate light.
Well, it's done by the dipole moment,
because it is the oscillating dipole which
is responsible for emitting and scattering light.
The dipole moment can, of course,
be obtained from the solution of the optical Bloch
equatio for the density matrix.
It is a trace of the density matrix times the operator
we are interested in.
And this involves the matrix element dge.

The dipole moment has only matrix elements
between excited and ground state.
And because I want an excited state I trace
a whole other parenthesis.
So this is the matrix element that we now
write down the density matrix in its matrix element
oge plus oeg.
But now we want to go from the rotating
frame back to the lab frame.
And the rotating frame rotates at omega.
So now I have to put back e to the i omega t and e
to the minus i omega t.
This is sort of going back from the rotating frame to the lab
frame.
And the picture we want to use is the--
the intuitive picture is to use the Bloch vector.
So I'm expressing now those matrix elements
by the component x and y of the Bloch vector.
And since the x and y component was the sum, or difference,
of the matrix, of the [? opthalmic ?] matrix element
of the density, meaning of the coherencies,
I get now cosine omega t and sine omega t.
So that tells us that one component is in-phase.
Well, in-phase means with respect to the driving field.
We assume that the system is driven by the classical field
[? in at ?] cosine omega t.
And now we find that the oscillating dipole moment,
it's a driven harmonic oscillator.
And there is a part which is driven in-phase
with the drive field and one which is in quadrature.
So we have those two components.
And the fact is now the following.
If we have an oscillating dipole these gives raise to emitted--
or more accurately, I should say, scattered light.
Remember, if you assume there is photon
first emitted and then a resonant photon
absorbed this picture is wrong.
You should rather think of scattering light.
But the light scattering is induced
by the oscillating dipole.
And what happens now is--
and this is why the Bloch vector and the Bloch sphere
is such a wonderful picture--
the dipole moment are the transverse component
of the Bloch vector.
So therefore you can say that if you
are interested in the spectrum of the emitted light what
you should find out is what is the spectrum of r.

Let me back up one step.
If you want to get the spectrum of the emitted light
from first principles--
I'm cheating a little bit here.
I'm saying let's get it from the dipole moment.
You should actually get it from the correlation function
of the dipole moment.
It's sort of the two time correlation function.
But you can show-- and this takes another 10, 20,
30 pages in API--

the-- what am I saying?
The temporal correlation function of the dipole moment
fulfills the same differential equation as a Bloch vector.
So I've given you here the intuitive link
that would oscillates.
It's the Bloch vector.
It emits it.
But technically, because you may not
control the phase of each atom, you
should rather say the spectrum is a correlation
function of the dipole.
And we should look at the spectrum of the correlation
function.
But instead I'm looking now at the spectrum
of the optical Bloch vector.
And you can show, mathematically,
exactly that they obey the same differential equation.
