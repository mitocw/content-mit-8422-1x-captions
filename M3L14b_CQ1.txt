Let's start with the first part, the spectrum and intensity
of emitted light.
And I want to start off this discussion with a clicker
question.
So the situation is that we have an atom which
is excited by laser light of frequency omega L.
The atom has frequency omega 0.
I'm discussing the limit of very low intensity.
And the question for you is what is the spectrum
of the emitted radiation?
So in other words, we have our atom.
We have the laser beam, which comes here.
And now the atom emits in all directions.
And you collect in frequency analyze the light.
And I want to give you four possibilities how
the spectrum of the emitted light may look like.
Let's assume that on the frequency axis
this is the laser frequency and this
is the frequency of the atom.
And the first possibility is that we
observe a spectrum which is centered
at the atomic frequency with aligned with gamma.
The second option is that we observe
a delta function, a very sharp peak, at the frequency omega 0.
The third possibility is that we observe a sharp peak
at the laser frequency.
And the fourth option is that we observe
radiation centered at the laser frequency but with bits gamma.
So I would ask you for your vote, A, B, C, or D.
Was there any question about--
questions about the choices?
Forty for in spectral, the low intensity
limit of light scatter emitted by an atom, which
is excited with a laser beam we can
assume close to resonance, but not on resonance,
so we can distinguish between the laser frequency
