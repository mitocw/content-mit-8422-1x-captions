So now you have already three different ways
to look at the Van der Waals potential.
One is just doing [INAUDIBLE] and not understanding anything.
The second one is the ground state
of two coupled oscillators, a la two capacitors.
And finally, the fact that spontaneous fluctuations create
stimulated fluctuations and then there is a quadratic term,
which doesn't vanish.

Let's now consider that there is a electromagnetic field.
Until now, we have not really used the fact
that we have an electromagnetic field with photons.
And the electromagnetic fields-- each mode
is an harmonic oscillator and each mode
of the electromagnetic field has 0 point fluctuation of itself.
So let us now discuss what can the vacuum
fluctuations of the electromagnetic field
do for us.
Well, if we have momentary fluctuations
of the electric field of the vacuum,
the fluctuation at position a and position b
will induce now dipole moments of the atom a and b
by multiplying with the atomic polarisability.
And if you assume--
I'll say a little bit more about it--
that we're talking about the long wavelengths fluctuation
of the electric field, then the two dipole moments--
which are induced by those vacuum fluctuations--
are actually in phase.
So the keyword is now that the vacuum fluctuations create
correlated dipole moments.
So that dipole moments are no longer independently
fluctuating by themselves.
So if you write down now the dipole interaction,
we will find a result which is proportional to the product
of the two polarisabilities.
The dipole interaction has an intrinsic spatial dependence,
which is 1 over r cubed.
But now, the important term is that we
have to calculate the correlation
function of the electric field at position a and position b.
And these are the vacuum fluctuations.
I'm not doing the calculation, because it
would be somewhat messy.
I will post on the web a fairly easy to read paper
by Larry Spruch in Physics Today.
And he gives you a little bit more details.
But you have already the physics in this equation.
What you should use now is you have
to use the density of modes.
And for each mode, the 0 point energy.
1/2 h bar omega.

And then what you get is, you get an interaction,
which is 1 over r to the 7.
Yes, [INAUDIBLE].
When learning [INAUDIBLE] only the dipole moment, which are
[INAUDIBLE].
So they're going from the fluctuation
of long movements, EM.
And one's the effect of those, but there
are EMs [INAUDIBLE] fluctuation from vacuum.
So what are the effect of those [INAUDIBLE] waves?
[INAUDIBLE]?
Excellent question.
Actually, In 10 minutes, I need exactly the answer
to your question.
So let me give you the answer right now.
If you look at this expression, there
are two things which come into place.
One is we have now two atoms separated by a distance
r, which is ra minus rb.
If you take now high frequency modes, which
are very short wavelengths, and you integrate and sum over
all of them, it's pretty clear that you
will get plus and minus, which will completely average out.
So it seems very clear that the modes with wavelengths
lambda definitely much shorter than r average out.
So therefore, the bulk of the contribution
will actually come from the modes
with wavelengths smaller than r.
But now there is something else.
The density of states for the electromagnetic field
dramatically increases with frequency omega.
So we have many more modes at short wavelengths.
So therefore, the argument says, well,
the long wavelengths mode up to wavelengths
are the dominant ones.
They don't average out, but because the density
of modes increases, the shorter the wavelengths is.
By far, the dominant contribution
will come from the modes, which are centered
around lambda equals r.
So the density of modes implies now
that those modes will dominate.
So that's your answer.
But ultimately, you have to put everything into an equation,
have an integral, solve the integral,
so some approximation.
And you will exactly see from the density of modes
that the very long wavelength don't contribute.
And you will also see that, because of rapid averagings
of e to the ikr phase factors, the high frequency
modes may not contribute.
OK, so we have now two different power laws.

One is 1 over r to the 6 and one is 1 over r to the 7.
And so let's explain that now.
So we obtain the 1 over r 6 by using the uncertainty principle
for atoms.
And here, we have used the uncertainty principle--
the 0 point fluctuations for electromagnetic waves.
When we derive the 1 over r 6 potential,
we actually used simply the electrostatic instantaneous
Coulomb field dipole field.
And this is only valued for short range.
I said, we have a fluctuation and the fluctuation
created another one, which was in phase.
But if one fluctuation has to send out
an electromagnetic wave, the second fluctuation
may not be in.
When propagation effects come into play
and there is a time lag between the two oscillators,
they may actually be out of phase.
So we really assumed in the derivation
without ever saying it explicitly
that there are no propagation effects.
And this is called the short range potential,
whereas, for the second argument, that we
said we have two distant atoms which get synchronized by being
driven by fluctuations of the electromagnetic wave
at wavelengths lambda equals r.
This is what happens at long range.
So this is a famous result that we
have Van der Waal's force, which is the instantaneous force.
And when propagation effects come into play,
this goes off by the name Casimir-Polder potential.
The moment when propagation effects come into play,
when radiation plays a role, we get a different power law.
Again, I'm just playing with ideas.
I'm taking a train of thought--
atoms fluctuate.
Another train of thought-- electromagnetic fields
propagate.
And just see, what are the ramifications?
What are the consequences?
So now I want to eventually give you
a treatment which has both aspects in one.
And this is our diagrammatic treatment.
First, before I do that, do you have
any idea what distinguishes the short range from the long range
potential?
So you have two atoms, you pull them apart.
At what distance do we have the 1 over r to the 6 physics?
At what distance do we have the 1 over r to the 7 physics?

[INAUDIBLE]
When the distance is the wavelengths
of the atomic concession.
That's the only thing which matters.
You don't get it immediately from here.

I mean, I used an instantaneous potential,
which didn't have any scale.
And here, I said, we are vacuum fluctuations
of all wavelengths.
So here, I had a picture which clearly
works at long separation.
And propagation effects are built in,
because it's a vacuum fluctuation, which
acts at position a and b.
And the wavelengths, the propagation
is part of the formulation.
But yes, [INAUDIBLE] conjecture that it
is the wavelengths of the atom.
The wavelengths of the [INAUDIBLE] radiation
is correct.
But I want to show you now how we
can obtain this result in a really elegant and beautiful
