So just a little bit of show and tell.
We have this Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
The Gross-Pitaevskii equation has as Schrodinger"s equation
a time independent form to get the ground state.
It has also a time dependent form.
You simply replace the energy by the derivative
of the wave function.
This is a time dependent form.
Everything is very simple.
And you can do many body physics, but on your computer
you pretty much look for similar particle wave function
and take them to the power n.
So some areas where the Gross-Pitaevskii equation
has quantitatively explained experiments,
one is the expansion of Bose-Einstein condensate.
It's this famous situation when you
have an elongated condensate and let it expand.
It expands faster in the radial direction.
One simple argument is the pressure
of the mean field is larger and leads to a faster acceleration.
So therefore, if you have a cigar-shaped condensate
and release it, it turns into a disk.
It inverts the aspect ratio going from a cigar shape
to a disk shape.
And that has been beautifully and quantitatively described
by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
Here we have measured the interaction energy
as a number of condensed atoms.
And I mentioned to you that this x perimeter comes often
with powers of one-fifths and two-fifth.
And this here is a feat to the power two-fifths beautifully
