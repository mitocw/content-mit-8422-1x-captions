OK, evaporative cooling.
Evaporative cooling is a powerful cooling scheme
to reach nanokelvin.
Actually, I forgot to update this slide.
I wanted to say this is the only technique so far
to reach quantum degeneracy for bosons and fermions.
Very recently, people have demonstrated laser cooling
of atomic strontium to quantum degeneracy,
but if you read the paper, it was laser cooling
aided not by evaporative cooling,
but by collisional redistribution of atoms.
It's like evaporation where you evaporate into and you keep--
read the paper, it's--

The scheme only worked because collisions--

how to say-- you cooled one region and another region
was cooled by collisions.
And this brings you pretty much back to, for example,
[INAUDIBLE] evaporation.
Anyway, what I wanted to say is there's a small footnote.
The field is evolving.
People you Can find now papers, laser cooling to be easy,
but if you read the paper carefully or if you talk to me,
I will tell you that there were still
collisions necessary, the same kind of collisions which
drive evaporative cooling.
But before we go into an expert discussion about variants
of evaporative cooling, I should first tell you
what evaporative cooling is.
But somebody raised his hand?
[INAUDIBLE], for example, lithium to quantum degeneracy,
[INAUDIBLE] and that would be just purely
laser cooling, right?
Subrecoil cooling has not--
so any form of laser cooling to subrecoil temperatures
was not compatible with high atomic densities.
It only worked at such low densities
that they stayed far away from quantum degeneracy.
So nanokelvin, yes, and temperature in the nanokelvin
range has been reached by laser cooling
but not at sufficiently high densities.
High density causes collisions.
Those collisions are screwing up laser
cooling so that it doesn't work anymore.
And the only technique which can reach nanokelvin temperatures
at sufficiently high densities is evaporative cooling.
And that applies to strontium.
Strontium was laser cooled at low density,
and then the low temperature was collisionally transferred
to a higher-density region.
So you can say, in a way, it's an oddity of nature
that we are now using quantum gases to reveal
new features of quantum physics using ultracold atoms,
but the cooling techniques which gets us
into the quantum degenerate regime
is pretty much classical.
So this is a cartoon picture how you could think
evaporative cooling works.
You have a thermal distribution.
You remove the high-energy tail of the thermal distribution,
and then you allow the distribution to relax.
And it will relax to a Boltzmann distribution, which
is a little bit shifted towards the colder, the low-energy,
side compared to the original dash distribution.
And if you do it again and again and again,
you wind up with a distribution of atoms which is colder
and colder, because every time you X away the high-energy
tail, you remove atoms which have, on average--
more than the average energy, and therefore,
the average energy per atom drops and drops and drops.
Of course, the atom number also drops rapidly,
and I was only able to draw it in this way
because I've been on, I think I--
actually, did I?
I forget what the normalization here is in the plot.
What is n [INAUDIBLE]?
N is the number of steps.
So after 25 removals of the high-energy tail, I'm here.
And after 50, I have a very, very narrow distribution.
So that tells you already something very powerful,
which people were not fully aware
before evaporative cooling of atoms
was invented that it doesn't take so long;
it doesn't take so many steps.
It takes 50 rethermalization steps,
and each rethermalization takes two or three
elastic collisions.
So what this already demonstrates,
if you can keep your atoms and evaporatively
cool by removing the high-energy atom,
after a time, which corresponds to a few hundred
elastic collision times, just a few hundred collisions,
