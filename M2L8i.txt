So what we want to do now is we want to do a calculation.
It's a perturbative calculation.
But we can take it to all orders.
So therefore, it's exact and general.
We want to do perturbative calculation of transition
amplitudes.
And what I'm following here--
the discussion in atom-photon interaction on those pages.
And the idea is the following--
we have the Hamiltonian for the atom.
And then we have an Hamiltonian which
describes transverse field and the intersection
of the transverse field with the atoms.
What we want to use is we want to use the interaction
picture, which is often the nicest picture
to describe the effect of an interaction between two
systems.
In the interaction picture, you are transforming
from your Schrodinger-type wave function
to wave function psi tilde.
And those wave function psi tilde include already
the dynamics of the Hamiltonian H0.
So that means that all operators in the normal Schrodinger
picture become now operators in the interaction picture
by a canonical transformation which
involves the dynamics due to the unperturbed Hamiltonian.
So that's just remind of what the interaction picture is.
And we are now interested what happens in the interaction
picture to an initial wave function psi of ti.
This wave function already includes the time evolution
due to H0.
So the only change now comes because we have interactions
with the electromagnetic field.
So this allows us now to focus only
on the relevant interactions, the interactions we
want to understand.
The formalism which is used in atom-photon interaction
focuses on the time evolution operator, which
I'm sure all of you have seen.
So the time evolution of our system--
how the wave function involves from the initial
to the final time is described by the time evolution operator.
I will come back to the wave function later.
But in order to derive the time evolution of the wave function,
it is convenient to focus first on the time evolution operator.
So in other words, I want to show
you a formal solution for the time evolution operator.
And once we know the time evolution operator,
we apply it to the wave function.
And then we are talking again about the wave function.

Since the derivation involves many equations
and they are all printed in the full beauty
in atom-photon interaction, I decided
to use pre-written slides here.
Also, most of it is fairly elementary.
The equations are complicated.
But the concepts behind them are very, very simple.
That's actually the beauty of using the time evolution
operator.
It's a little bit mathematically formal.
But it allows us to express what is really
going on in the solution in very, very simple terms.
So the goal is to do a perturbative expansion
for the time evolution operator.
If you have no interaction potential V,
the interaction picture--
nothing happens in the interaction picture,
and therefore the time evolution operate as a unity matrix.
But if you have a coupling term V, there is time evolution.
And the time evolution can be treated in lowest or in higher
orders in the perturbation.
And we want to use now perturbative expansion where
we have correction terms, which is
the first-order, second-order, and n-th-order correction
to the time evolution operator.
So what we simply want to do is we want
to do an iterative solution.
We want to find an iterative solution for the time evolution
operator.

The next two lines is just a reminder
what is the differential equation for the time evolution
operator.
Well, we are really just talking about Schrodinger's equation.
Schrodinger's equation for the wave function
turns into differential equation for the time evolution
operator.
Schrodinger's equation in the interaction picture
says that the time derivation of the wave
function in the interaction picture
has nothing to do with H0.
H0 has already been absorbed in the definition of the wave
function.
So the time evolution in the interaction picture
only comes from the interaction term.
And now if you write the wave function at time tf
as the time-evolved wave function from the initial time
to the final time, then you take the derivation here.
You actually take the derivation of the time evolution operator,
and therefore in one step from Schrodinger's equation,
you find the differential equation for the time evolution
operator.
In other words, this is now the operator equation for the time
evolution operator.
And it's nothing else than a 100% rewrite of the Schrodinger
equation.

Interrupt me if you have questions.
This part should be--
we go through that for solely pedagogical reasons.
And that means you should really understand it.
So this equation can now be formally solved
in the following way.
Take this expression for the time evolution operator
and insert it in this equation.
And you find an identity.
Of course, you haven't really solved it
because you have the time evolution operator expressed
by the time evolution operator.
This looks like a circular conclusion,
which is just nonsense.
But if you inspect it more closely,
you observe that the time evolution operator here
is expressed by the time evolution operator multiplied
with V. And if you know think in an iterative solution
that we want to express--
we want to expand the time evolution operator
in the different orders in the interaction parameter V,
then you find, actually, that if you are only
interested in the first order of the interaction operator,
you can use the zeroth order here
because you get one more power of V.
So that's how you get the first order.
If you want to know the second order of the time evolution
operator, you can plug in the first order
on the right-hand side.
So therefore, you get an iterative solution.
The first-order solution is 1.
The zeroth-order solution is a unity operator.
The first-order solution is by just putting the unity operator
here.
The second-order solution is by taking
the first-order solution, plugging it in in here,
and then you get two integrals over the operator V.
So in that sense, we have formally
solved the time evolution of the system in all orders.
So this is what we get out of it.
Yes, the equations are getting longer.
But the structure is fairly obvious.
So you saw that the--
maybe let me just flash back--
the first-order term had a temporal integral over V.
The second-order term has two temporal integrals over V.
And there's a time order in between tau 1 and tau 2.
And the n-th-order term now involves n temporal integrals
where the times are order in such a way.

Now we want to go back to the Schrodinger equation.
So we want to use this already fairly complicated expression
for the time evolution operator and apply it
to the initial wave function.
And we want to calculate matrix elements
between the initial wave function and some other phi f--
some other wave function in a given basis.
So we are also going back.
I don't want to go through too many steps here.
We're also going back to the original Schrodinger picture.
So I've taken all the tildes off.
But you know the step from the Schrodinger
picture to the interaction picture
was only taking out the Hamiltonian H0.
And the Hamiltonian H0 for eigenstates phi i and phi f
is simply a time evolution e to the e [? Ei ?]
with a certain time.
So all what this transformation to the intersection picture
gave us--
it eliminated, at least for a short while,
all of those phase factors, which
is simply the evolution of the eigenfunctions in Schrodinger
picture.

So let me look at a typical term, which we have right now.
And you can't expect something simpler than this
because this is the general solution.
It's an exact solution to all orders.
It's a summation over terms to all orders.
And eventually, the summation of an infinite number of diagrams
is an exact solution.
So what we got here is we have an integral over n times.
And the n times are time-ordered.
This is the formal solution for the time evolution operator.
And that means that we integrate over all times.
But what is under the integral sign
is the product of the operator V at times
tau 1, tau 2, tau 3, tau 4.

Since we got back to the Schrodinger picture, what
happens is between tau-- times tau 1 and tau 2,
the particle simply evolves with a phase factor
given by the Hamiltonian H0.
So the picture is the following--
the time evolution operator in the interaction picture
is a product over the operator V tilde at different times.
If you simply plug it back into the above equation--
and you have to look at it for a little while to see that
everything works out correctly--
but what that means is then that if you go to the Schrodinger
picture and write down the operator in the Schrodinger--
in the basis of unperturbed eigenfunction,
that you have products of the operator V at times t1, tau 2,
tau 3.
They are time-ordered.

And because we have left the interaction picture,
you also get the propagation with the phase factors
given by the eigenenergies of the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0.
So therefore, you get just an infinite number
of terms, which have all the following structure--
that the particle propagates in its eigenstate.
It reaches a vertex where the interaction switches
the particle from one state to the next.
Then in the next state, which may now be the excited state,
we have propagation in the excited state.
Then the excited state is again exchanging a photon,
has an interaction term, and they switch to--
well, for the two-level system, it
has to go back to the ground state.
In a more general situation, it goes to another quantum state.
So therefore, we have exactly derived
is that the propagation or the time evolution of the wave
function is nothing else than many, many of those factors.
And each of those factors can be represented
by a diagram like this.
So let me just write down what this diagram here
means mathematically.
It means that initially, we have a photon of energy epsilon--

of polarization epsilon, wave factor k, and a certain energy.
And we have particles in state a.
That means that we get from the initial time to the time tau 1.
And tau 1 is the time of the first vertex
of the first photon exchange that the wave function evolves.

And it evolves with an energy of the unperturbed Hamiltonian,
which is the atomic energy.
And we have one photon H bar omega.

At the time tau 1, and this is when
the diagram on the left-hand side has a vertex,
we are now bringing in the interaction operator,
which acts on the atom.
It takes the atom from state a to state b.
And it changes the state of the photon.
In this case, a photon with a certain wave
factor and polarization simply disappears.
So this is now the time tau 1.
The next vertex is reached at time tau 2.
And between the time tau 2 and tau 1,
the system evolves according to the Hamiltonian H0.
And the energy is now, because we have no photon,
is simply the energy of the atom in state b.
Then we reach the next vertex.
We start with a state b and no photon.
The interaction switches us now--
I assumed we have more than two levels-- to a state c.
And we have now a photon which may be different k
prime epsilon prime.

For this given example, I've selected n
equals 2, something which is second order
in the perturbation.
But that means now that between the time tau
2 and the final time for the time propagation
that's now everything is done.
Things propagate.
And the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0
give us now a phase factor which reflects
the energy of the atomic state and the energy
of the photon in mode k prime epsilon prime with energy
H bar omega prime.
So in other words, I hope you see that at the end of this--
this is why people love Feynman diagrams.
It's a complicated, involved mathematical formulation
with multiple integrations.
But at the end of the day, what we have derived
is that the most general solutions
to all orders in the perturbation
is nothing else than a sum and integral
over diagrams like this.
So when I depicted here the second-order diagram,
of course, this is-- has an exact mathematical meaning.
And what we have to do is when we solve [INAUDIBLE] equation,
we have to now allow those interactions which
happen at time tau 1 and tau 2 to happen at arbitrary times.
So therefore, we have to sum over amplitudes
by integrating over times tau 1 and tau 2.
On Friday, I will show you that with this description,
we have actually captured everything
I explained to you earlier--
those virtual states, the emission
of virtual or real photons.
So everything which was maybe qualitative at the beginning
of this section has now a precise mathematical meaning.
