So we need minima of the magnetic field.
This provides magnetic trapping potential,
and there are two kinds of possible trap configuration.
One is where the minima is symmetric magnetic field,
and one is where the minima is a finite magnetic field.
Now the symmetric magnetic field minimum
can be simply created with an anti-Helmholtz coil.
What happens is the magnetic field,
as a function of position, would actually cross from 0.
It's just the field gradient which crosses from 0.
But of course, since we are interested
in the absolute value of the magnetic field,
we get the V-shaped potential.
This V-shaped potential was what was
used for the first demonstration for Bose-Einstein condensation
because a V-shaped potential is much, much more
confining in this [? cusp ?] than in harmonic oscillator
potential.
And this had advantages for tight confinement
and rapid evaporative cooling.
So those quadrupole traps with the V-shaped potential
are the best confinement you can get,
the best confinement for the buck.
And the buck here is your power supply and your coils.
However, they have a problem.
When the magnetic field is 0, we violate [INAUDIBLE]
because the different spin configurations
become degenerate.
And in degenerates, you can't have [INAUDIBLE].
So therefore, the two first demonstrations
of Bose-Einstein condensation avoided this [? cusp ?]
in two different ways.
One way was to use a rotating magnetic field,
and to use a perpendicular field,
but which was time dependent.
And the MIT solution was to use a [INAUDIBLE] tuned laser beam.
You see optical dipole trap, optical dipole potential,
to push the atoms away from the dangerous symmetric field
region.
I should say most traps which are now used
are the other kind of trap--
the trap which has a harmonic oscillator potential,
which doesn't have the cusp, and where the minimum is
at a finite magnetic field.
Let me just make one comment.
The rotating trap was very popular
because it led to the first [INAUDIBLE]
a lot of people who believe that.
But to the best of my knowledge, it's only used in a few places.
And the only real application it has
is since you have some rotating magnetic field,
by some modification you can actually
make a rotating potential.
And this is nice if you want to study
Bose-Einstein condensation in a rotating frame between vortices
and things like that.
But for simply creating a Bose-Einstein condensate,
this trap is used by far most frequently.
But there is actually a Renaissance of this trap.
I mean, one reason why people use this trap,
and why my own research group immediately
switched to this trap and we had the idea how to build it,
is well, harmonic potential is nice.
Every physicist loves an harmonic potential.
You can solve immediately thermodynamics
in a harmonic potential.
Who wants to deal with that potential?
Also, if the laser beam just drifts by a micrometer,
the symmetric potential becomes asymmetric.
So you characterize your potential today,
and a few hours later you have a different potential.
Whereas, a magnetic potential-- harmonic potential--
once it's characterized, as long as you don't change the current
in your power supplies it's the same week after week, month
after month.
Well, there is a Renaissance now because a lot of groups
now do experiments in optical lattices.
They don't care what shape the potential is because they don't
do physics in this potential.
They just take the Bose-Einstein condensate--
or they're called Fermi gases--
and transfer them to an optical lattice.
So in that case, it doesn't play any role.
And then, the advantage of this potential
is you get more bang for the buck.

You're saying for using it a much more rapid evaporation
in the V-shaped versus the [INAUDIBLE].
Yeah.
What are sort of the differences in the evap time?
It depends.
I may run out of time today.
I need it.
I wanted to go through evaporative cooling,
and I will talk to that for evaporative
cooling there could be a threshold in confinement
where you go into a runaway regime
that evaporative cooling is speeding up.
So if you are--

little bit of confinement can make the difference
without never getting into a runaway regime,
or being in the runaway regime.
So confinement, extra confinement,
can make the difference between getting a BEC
and not getting a BEC.

So it really depends.
It's highly non-linear.
But I will show you later on that
when you put the system together that the kind of threshold
density at which the cloud can evaporate to BEC
is much lower here than it is there.

But-- and this is the next thing I want to explain--
it's not really that this is a linear potential
and this is a quadratic potential
because those finite magnetic field--
these traps which have a minimum at a finite magnetic field
are usually done in the following way.
Those traps are called Ioffe-Pritchard Trap.
Ioffe actually suggested such a magnetic field configuration
for confinement of plasma.
And Dave Pritchard was the first to point out
that such a configuration would be a good choice
for neutral atoms.
So I sometimes joke, and I say, well, plasma physics is
the study of very hot matter.
Cold atoms it's the study of very cold matter.
But when matter is either too hot or too cold that you cannot
put it in an ordinary container, you want to confine it with
magnetic fields.
And it happens that for plasma you
need a minimum of the magnetic field.
And for neutral atoms, you need a minimum
of the magnetic field.
So therefore, here is something which ultra cold atoms have
in common with plasma physics.
I don't think there is a lot the two fields have in common,
but when it comes to magnetic field configurations, yes.
Similar magnetic field configuration
can confine a plasma, and can confine neutral atoms.
OK, so the generic way of how these magnetic fields
are generated is you want to have
two coils called pinch coils.
You can say each of them creates a magnetic field, which decays,
a magnetic field which decays, and now in the middle
you have the parabolic minimum.
But then, you have to add the so-called four Ioffe
bars, which create a linear potential.
And this is shown here.
So the pinch coil is simply creating a local minimum
along the z-axis.
And if you only want to trap in one dimension,
you would be done.
But you want to trade in three dimension.
And so, what happens is you add out
an anti-Helmholtz, or quadrupole field in x and y.
And this blue field is done by the green bars,
by the Ioffe bars.
So you add together a harmonic quadratic field
in the z direction with a linear quadrupole field in x and z--
x and y.
And what matters for the atoms is--
and what matters for the [? zamen ?]
energy is the absolute value of the magnetic field.
So you add those things in quadrature,
and because you add it in quadrature,
you have now an harmonic oscillator
potential in x, y, and z.
So you have an harmonic trap in three directions.
However, if this field is not larger than this--
if this field becomes larger than this field--
so then when you add it in quadrature,
you actually get a linear potential.
So in other words, the Ioffe-Pritchard trap
is quadratic for small values of x and y.
But if you go out to large x and y,
you get the linear potential.
So in the end, and this is maybe--
this point to Matt's question-- for high temperature,
the Ioffe-Pritchard trap is actually not
harmonic in three dimensions.
It's linear in two dimensions and harmonic
in the third dimension.
So therefore, the hit you take in evaporative cooling
is not as large as we had initially assumed.
And the moment we realized that, we were building
a Ioffe-Pritchard Trap.
And this has been the traps we have
been using at MIT ever since.
Well just as a warning, this is sort
of the simplified description.
But if you have curvature, the curvature
has to fulfill Maxwell's equation.
And you cannot have a curvature only along z.
Maxwell's equations are three-dimensional,
so you get sort of all sorts of curvature terms.
If you really build a magnetic trap,
you should understand those.
If you just want to understand why magnetic traps work,
the previous slide is sufficient.
There are different ways to build those traps.
This is a design we invented at MIT.
It's called a cloverleaf trap.
So you have one coil, one coil package
here, another coil package here.
And what you see is the pinch coils,
and when you have two of them, you
create this parabolic minimum.
We don't like Ioffe bars because if you have a vacuum chamber
you either have to put the Ioffe bars into the vacuum chamber,
or you have to drill holes through your vacuum chamber
to put the Ioffe bars back in force.
Don't laugh, some people have done it, of course.
They put little tubes around it--
so the very highly engineered vacuum
chamber where they could string Ioffe bars through the chamber.
But we realized that the same field as Ioffe bars
can be generated by taking the Ioffe bars
and flipping them out.
And after flipping them out, they
have the shape of cloverleaves.
It's just a variant of creating the same field geometry.
Yes.
