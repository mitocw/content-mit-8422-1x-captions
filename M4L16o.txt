So you'll remember, we had the dissipative force
of each laser beam.
Now, we have two laser beams.
We sum them up, because the two laser
beams come from different directions with a minus sign
here.
And for the same reason, we have plus and minus sign
in the Doppler effect.
So what we have is the following.
Each force of each laser beam has this Lorentzian envelope,
shown in black.
But the other force of the other laser beam
has the opposite sign.
And the two have opposite Doppler shifts.
So if I add up the two black forces, I get the rate force.
And the rate force is anti-symmetric with respect
to velocity.
So therefore, in the limit of small velocities,
I get a force, which is minus alpha times v. And this
is the force of friction.
And in a whimsical way, people called this arrangement of two
traveling waves, optical molasses,
because the atom literally gets stuck in this configuration,
like a tiny ball bearing you throw into honey.
So this is optical molasses.
Actually, I think some of the Europeans
had to learn the word, "molasses, for it.
In the US, everybody knows what molasses is.
While in Europe, we know what honey is.
But molasses is not a standard staple.
But anyway, it's optical molasses.
OK.
Very simple result. And again, it's
not easy to get it out of this stimulated force,
but it's possible.
I will actually tell you how we get
cooling out of the stimulated force later in some limit.
[INAUDIBLE] is it because the reason--
like the assumption of dissipative forces
is easier for this derivation?
And the stimulated force will be like [INAUDIBLE]
for the assumptions?

I'm not sure if there is a simple answer why it's easier--
well, it can't be easier than that.
Then there has to be something wrong with our assumptions
of stimulated force, so that we cannot get [INAUDIBLE].
Yep.
I think what happens is what I briefly said.
To the best of my knowledge-- but I'm not 100% certain--
we have the simple expression because we
have used the steady state solution of the optical Bloch
equation.
In other words, we have a laser beam.
And it's just the power of the laser
which tells us how much light scattering happens.
And we use the steady state solution.
And we sort of have folded that into the force for one laser
beam.
And then, we have the same package
for the other laser beam.
And we have never considered that the two laser
beams may have some cross-talk.
And this is indeed valid for low laser power.
However, if you want to get cooling out
of the stimulated force, I will show some of it to you later,
you can no longer use the steady state solution,
because it would miss the effect here.
You wouldn't get any cooling out of it.
In order to get something which is dissipative out
of the reactive force-- reactive force
is, by definition, not dissipative-- you
need a dissipation mechanism.
And the dissipation mechanism is that you're not
quite steady state.
There is a relaxation time, a time lag.
The atom is not instantaneously in its steady state solution,
it needs a little bit of time to adjust.
And it is this time lag of the atom which eventually
gives rise to an alpha coefficient
in the stimulated force.
So then, physically, you are doing cooling experiments
if you take care that the [INAUDIBLE] in the steady state
limit?

What I'm telling you is, for the spontaneous force,
we get, in leading order, the effect,
by assuming the steady state limit.
But if you want to get it out of the stimulated force,
as far as I know, you don't get it with a steady state limit.

So you have to use--
if you use different approaches--
I mean, this is why you want to pick your approach.
Sometimes, you get something already in lower order.
Sometimes, you get it in higher order.
And I think one favorite example is
you solve this problem about radio scattering
and Thomson scattering pick your Hamiltonian-- d dot e,
or p minus a.
In one case, you have to work harder than in the other case.
And I think, here, it's similar.
