I want to discuss what happens now to the force when
the atom is slowly moving.
Remember, there is still one phenomenon which
I owe you an explanation for.
And this is when we discuss molasses.
We always had the effect in optical molasses
with a spontaneous light force that we
need red detuning of the laser beam to get cooling.
The simple picture is the atom absorbs a red detuned photon
and emits away a resonant photon.
And the net energy difference is taken away
from the kinetic energy, and this is cooling.
But then I told you that when you
go to higher power of the standing wave,
the sine of alpha of the friction coefficient reverses.
And that means cooling is now done by blue detuned light.
Heating is done by red detuned light.
And that's what we want to understand.
Well, in order to get any cooling effect or heating
effect, we have to now change the equation we had
for the average dipole force.
Remember also, the average dipole force--
we did that earlier--
can be derived from a potential.
It's a gradient of a potential.
So therefore, when you fly through a laser beam,
you go down and up or up and down the potential,
but nothing has happened to you.
But the assumption we had for that
is that the dipole force was calculated
with a steady-state population.
So now we want to see if the atom is slowly moving,
it may not be fully adiabatic, and we
want to calculate the first correction
to the non-adiabaticity.
So in other words, we have the following picture--
when an atom flies through the laser beam,
it needs a certain time to adjust its population.
And we question, what is this time?
Well, it is relaxation time for the populations
among the dressed states to adjust.
And this is exactly the inverse of the rate gamma [INAUDIBLE],
which we have calculated earlier.

So the physical picture now is that in the dressed level
1 and 2, the population at any given moment
is almost a steady state, but there is a time lag--
a time lag by the time it takes to relax.
So in other words, the atom is always a little bit
behind in adjusting to the laser field
because it takes a finite amount of time.
So let's now try to understand in this picture, which we have
obtained with a laser beam, the two dressed levels and the atom
flying through, let's try to understand
what this extra lag time means.
So the atom is flying into the laser beam.
It starts out in the ground state,
which means 100% in the upper dressed energy level.
Now in the laser beam, the higher the laser power is,
the more there is an admixture of the other dressed energy
level.
But what happens is, when the atom is here--
when it just zoom, it flies in--
and there was not enough time to adjust the population, that
would mean that the atom--
and this is indicated with the red dots--
that the atom has a little bit of more population in the upper
dressed level than it would have in equilibrium.
But what does it mean for the force
now if there is more population here than there?
Well, the more population you have in the upper state,
the more you are climbing up a hill,
the more you get a force to the left.
So this red arrow shows due to the non-adiabaticity,
due to the time lag, there is a little extra force
to the left-hand side.
So this is on uphill.
Let's now understand what happens on the downhill.
Well, we just have to keep track of signs.
Here, the atom, in a fairly high laser field,
is in the upper dressed level with an admixture in the lower
dressed level.
But now it flies out of the laser beam,
but it cannot immediately adjust its population.
And that means it wants to have, now, more population
in the upper dressed level, but it hasn't fully adjusted.
So therefore, instead of having the blue bullet,
which represents equilibrium, the atom has the red bullet.
It has a little bit lower population
in that and higher population there.
But lower population here and higher population
here means, if you have a little bit higher population
than you should have here, it means
you are climbing up the hill.
And there is an extra force, which is, again, to the left.
So we realize the non-adiabaticity,
the time lag means when an atom goes up the hill,
there's a little bit extra force to the left.
And when it goes down the hill, there's
a little bit extra force to the left.
And after it has flown through, the steady state part
of the force roller-coaster up down,
which can be derived from a potential, has integrated to 0.
But what is left is this non-adiabatic component
of the force, which is slowing down the atom.
In other words, I have shown you in this simple picture
that the time lag in adjusting the dressed energy population
means that there is a small differential force which
is slowing down the atom.
And what I assumed here was blue detuning.
So we have cooling.
We have friction for blue detuned light
when it comes to the simulated force.

Now, this picture, this equation that the population is
a steady state at a given position minus a time
lag, we can solve it.
And I'm not doing it here, because it involves
a few mathematical equations.
But by just using this ansatz, and the rest
is straightforward, you can then arrive
at an expression for the stimulated
for the dipole force.
Colin.
In the spirit of last time, keeping track of energy,
the energy here would be going into the fact
that now I have, if the atom's a harmonic oscillator,
it's a little behind the drive field.
Yes.
So you imprint some fluctuating on the [INAUDIBLE]
and that's where the energy is being carried off
in the laser beam?

Well the energy is carried off by the laser beam.
I have actually prepared something,
which I'm going to show you in 10 or 15
minutes, where the energy goes.
So let's maybe do that in a moment.
So this is the physical picture.
And I think what is also important I want to later tell
you for other laser cooling mechanisms, which are
too complicated to describe.
But they also have a time lag.
And I think I try to teach you basic concepts by using
the simplest physical picture I can have.
And what can be simpler than two levels of an atom and one laser
beam?
But what you understand here with this stimulated force,
which is also called blue molasses
is, for the first time, how a time
lag, in adjusting to the local laser field,
how that leads to cooling.
OK, I'm summarizing here, simply taking
this picture, this equation, and turning the crank on it,
the paper by Jean Dalibard and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji
calculates what is the dipole force in steady state.
We get almost the same result with the Optical Bloch
Equations, but we're discussing here
the limit that the Rabi frequency is larger than gamma.
So therefore, if you are missing occurrences of gamma,
they don't appear here, because we've always
assumed omega is larger than gamma in this picture.
OK, now I want to apply this picture now,
not just going through one hump of the laser field,
but going through a standing wave.
So we have a standing wave of light, which is blue detuned.

Of course, in a standing wave of light,
if you average over one optical wavelength--
you go up the hill, you go down the hill--
the lambda average dipole force is 0.

But now you find that if you put in this time lag,
you find a friction force with a friction coefficient alpha.
And this friction coefficient is cooling for blue detuned light.
Now I don't want to elaborate on this expression,
but if you take the treatment of Jean Dalibard and Claude
Cohen-Tannoudji, which is very transparent.
It reads wonderfully easily as a [INAUDIBLE]
atom-photon interaction.
In the limit of large detuning, which is the simplest
possible limit, you find the friction coefficient,
which looks highly nontrivial.
It depends to the sixth power of the Rabi frequency and such.
The only reason why I put it here, in 20 minutes,
I want to give you a very, very simple picture where
I derive that for you.
So that's just a check mark.
OK, any questions right now about--
because I want to go on-- about the stimulated force
in the dressed atom picture?
And if we allow deviations from the steady-state population,
we get a cooling effect.
And this explains the effect of blue molasses,
and we've applied it here to a standing wave.
Colin.
[INAUDIBLE] the upper alpha is our upper [INAUDIBLE] constant,
the lower one is the polarizability?
No, thanks for asking.
Alpha, yeah, we're recycling Greek letters.
Here it's the friction coefficient.
Here, remember when we had the light force,
the spontaneous light force and the stimulated light force.
One was directed along a vector alpha, and the other one
along a vector beta.
Alpha was pointing into the direction of the gradient
of the laser intensity.
And beta was the phase gradient of the laser beam.
So those two have nothing to do.
This is friction coefficient.
This is the direction for the stimulated light force.
And yes, a little bit later today,
I will use alpha again, but for the polarizability.
Yes.
I have a question.
The [INAUDIBLE] atoms in the blue detuning standing
wave [INAUDIBLE] in the regular [INAUDIBLE]
in the regular [INAUDIBLE].
We're talking not about trapping here.

If you have a standing wave of blue detuned light,
well, if the standing wave is infinitely extended,
then the atom is always in the standing wave.
But if you use two Gaussian laser beams to form a standing
wave, there is always a net force
to expel the atoms away from blue detuned light,
because blue detuned light has an average dipole
force which is repulsive.
So whenever you want to manipulate atoms
with blue detuned light, you need
an additional magnetic trap or an additional red detuned
optical trap.
Because whatever you want to do with atoms,
if you want to do it with atoms in steady state,
you have to keep the atoms together.
And what keeps the atoms together
is red detuned optical traps or magnetic traps.
The blue detuned light can be used
to create a blue detuned lattice.
Or it can be used--
at least if you want to do laser cooling
with blue detuned light, it can be used for laser cooling,
as I've started to describe for you now.

But yes, I mean, in that sense, as an experimentalist,
you can run experiments where you have only red detuned
light-- red detuned light for trapping,
red detuned light for cooling.
But if you use blue detuned light for a standing wave
or for a blue molasses, in addition,
you will always use red detuned light
to keep the clouds together.
So pretty much every experiment usually
has some red detuned light for confinement.
And you have to then mix blue detuned light
with red detuned light to get the two things you want.
