Let me show you one nice piece of physics, which
can be formulated both in the air, in the uncoupled
and in the dressed state basis.
And this is the process of spontaneous emission.
If an atom is in the laser field,
it just emits photons, rapid-fire photons.
And I want to show you now how we would describe it
in the bare basis, how we describe it
in the dressed basis, and we get two very different physical
pictures out of it.
In the bare basis, maybe just think of quantum Monte Carlo
simulation.
A photon has been emitted.
And that means we are in the ground state.
Now, it takes a Rabi cycle before the ground state
atom is in the excited state.
And when it is in the excited state, it can emit again,
and goes back to the ground state.
And then things start over.
So the picture you obtain here is the picture
of anti-bunching--
that the atom emits a photon, but then
it takes the inverse Rabi frequency
to load the gun again.
And then it can fire again, and emit the next photon.
So therefore, the probability of getting another photon right
after you've observed the first photon is reduced or at t
equals 0, it is exactly 0.
And this is anti-bunching.
The photons are anti-bunched.
So this is how we would describe the radiative cascade, how
we go from n to n minus 1 to n minus 2-- how we lose photons
from the laser field and dump them
into the anti modes of the vacuum.
That's how we describe it in the uncoupled basis.
Well, in the dressed basis, we have sort of
diagonalized the atoms interacting
with the strong laser field.
And now we have the following picture.
We have this manifold here.
We can emit from this manifold, and we
can go to the upper or lower dressed state.
And then the next thing will happen again.
But what we realize here, if we are in the upper dressed state,
we can either emit on the carrier,
or we can emit a blue detuned side band.
But once we have emitted a blue detuned side band,
the next side band has to be red detuned, because we are now
in the lower dressed state, and we need a lower side band
to go back to the upper dressed state.
So what this picture gives us, it gives us the side bands
because we are resolving the splitting in this picture.
And secondly, it tells us that there
is an alternation between the blue detuned photons
and a red detuned photon.

Now you would say, well aren't those two pictures
really different?
In one case, we have anti-bunching,
and all the photons are the same.
And over here, I talk about an alternation between a blue
and a red side band.
Well, again, the two pictures are complementary.
In this case, if I want to resolve the anti-bunching,
I need a temporal resolution which
is better than the inverse Rabi frequency.
But if my temporal resolution is better than the inverse Rabi
frequency, then I don't have the spectral resolution
to observe the sidebands, and vice versa.
If I want to resolve the side bands,
if I want to distinguish the red from the blue detuned side band
of the Mollow triplet, I cannot run the experiment with respect
to resolution which would be required to observe
the anti-bunching.
So these are sort of two different pictures.
One is sort of in terms of energy eigenstates
when we have spectral resolution.
And this other picture is more appropriate
when we are interested in the short time domain.
So in that sense, you need both.
You need the bare basis.
You need the dressed basis.
And you have to just know for which physical process, which
