We started with two beams.
We just discussed one beam.
Trap slowing.
And let's go now to what most of you use in the laboratory,
namely six beams.
You want to cool in xyz, so you have one-dimensional molasses
with two beams times three.
So in the limit that the intensity is low,
you just add up all the forces.
You say each beam has a spontaneous light force
and you add the six spontaneous light forces up.

At low intensity-- and you have to take my word for it--
you can ignore all the interference effect
between the beams.
They can actually lead to very interesting effects.
I will give you at least a taste what will happen--
actually, pretty good taste--
what happens at higher power.
We need the dressed atom picture,
and we'll discuss how the stimulated force can
be used for cooling.

But if you don't have a two-level system,
you have sigma plus, sigma minus transitions.
And the beams interfere.
You get spatially varying polarizations
of your interference patterns.
And then you have [INAUDIBLE] physics.
But in the simplest case of a two-level system,
there is a regime at low intensity
where you can simply take the equations we get,
work out for molasses, and apply them to xyz.

I put on the web site a nice handout, a review paper
by Bill Phillips, who is discussing
1D molasses versus 3D molasses.
And if you enjoy it, you can read
how numerical factors of one, or two, or three
now appear in the friction coefficient,
in the heating coefficient, and then
how they affect the final temperature.
But you got the full concepts and the correct idea
from one-dimension molasses.

Now let me give you an outlook for what
we will be doing next week.
Next week, we want to understand the following.
What happens to the friction coefficient
when we increase the power?
Well, you'll remember when we have red detuned light,
then we had one [? Laurentian, ?] another
[? Laurentian. ?] The slope was negative,
and negative means positive friction.
We cool.
And if you put more power into it, the linear slope increases.
And for low power, the friction coefficient
is proportional to the laser intensity.
But now look what happens.
If you approach saturation, then the friction is not
only saturating, it suddenly changes the sign.
And this is qualitatively new.
And you should little bit wonder about it.
Wasn't the reason why we have cooling that you have
a laser which is red detuned?
And the photon which is spontaneously emitted
is on resonance and this is the energy difference.
But now I'm telling you at high intensity,
it's not the red detuned laser which cools,
it's the blue detuned laser.
So you should wonder about it.
There is really something new to be learned.
So I want to motivate you to follow me today and next week
through an alternative description
of what light does to atoms using the dressed atom picture.
And in the dressed atom picture, we
will very naturally understand why now blue detuned light
provides cooling.
But right now for you, this should be a mystery.
But it should be something where you say hey,
still something qualitative is missing in our understanding
of light forces.
OK, I will not be able to explain it to you to explain
it physically to you.
I first have to introduce the dressed atom picture,
and I will do that in 10 minutes or so.
But what I want to do here is, if I'm telling you
something goes terribly wrong, and we completely
miss even the sign of the force.
Blue detuned light is now cooling, not red detuned light,
I at least wanted to tell you what went wrong.
Because haven't we done an exact, almost exact discussion
of light forces?
We use the gradient of d dot e.
We used for d the steady state solution of the optical block
equations.
Haven't we done everything right?
Well, we did approximations.
And what happens is, and this is the reason
for those qualitatively different things, that we
should, in order to get those effects,
not use for the dipole moment, for the off-diagonal matrix
elements of the density matrix, the steady state solution
for the optical block vector.
We have to acknowledge that it always takes a finite time
to reach steady state.

For instance, if it takes, let's say, a spontaneous emission
time, the atom has to, if the atom goes through a standing
wave, it goes from high intensity to low intensity,
it takes about one spontaneous emission time.
When you are highly excited, but now you
go through a node of this standing wave,
the steady state solution is hey,
at the node of the standing wave, there is no light.
The steady state solution with no light
is you better go back to the ground state.
But that takes something on the order
of the spontaneous emission time.
So therefore, when I'm excited because I'm
in the middle of the bright laser beam,
and I go fast into the dark region,
I'm still excited, because I didn't have time
to get rid of my excitation.
In other words, the internal degree of freedom,
the population of ground and excited state
will lag behind the steady state solution
by a lag time which is a spontaneous emission time.
And if the lag time, and that would
mean if I multiply with the velocity
it's pretty much that there is a spatial displacement.

I'm always a certain distance away from the steady state
solution.
And actually this point, to introduce the lag time,
we will do it in a wonderful physical way
when we have the dressed atom picture.
But it can be done with optical block equation.
It's just a real pain, because the optical block equation
is like a matrix equation.
You have to do--
it's completely obscure how it is done.
But in order that you convince yourself,
I posted the original paper from Gordon and Ashkin
where this was done.
You read the math.
You will understand the result, but you
don't understand the derivation, the physical picture behind it.
The dressed atom picture will give us a lucid explanation
for exactly what a lag time does,
and why this results in cooling.
But anyway, this is the physics we have done wrong.
At low power, it's OK.
At high power, we really have to take care of this effect.

And if we take care of this effect--
and as I said, we don't need the dressed atom picture.
We can fully do it within the framework of the optical block
equation, but it's messy--
we would actually get out, and you
see that in the references, the result
that the friction coefficient in a standing wave at weak power
is exactly two times the friction coefficient
for a traveling wave.
And that justifies that we describe molasses
by the spontaneous light force of two traveling waves,
completely ignoring the standing wave.
But the same treatment of the optical block equation
will then eventually give us a result that alpha changes sign
at high intensity.
But as I said, I want to describe
that after we have introduced the dressed atom picture.
