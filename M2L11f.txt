Our next big chapter is on resonant scattering.
Just as you see the structure of the cause--
I wanted to introduce some mysteries and subtleties
of electromagnetic interactions to you, by using diagrams,
by using an exact formulation of QED.
And, then I gave you one example where
we could use source diagrams.
And these were van der Waal's forces.
So then we got a little bit sidetracked with the vacuum
with van der Waal's and Casimir forces.
But, now we want to go back to the diagrams.
And there is one aspect of the diagrams
which is sort of fascinating.
And, this is where you really need a treatment which
goes beyond perturbation theory, and this
is when we have resonant radiation when resonant light--
when resonant light interacts with atoms because,
as I want to show you, we have then
in any perturbative expression Zero in the energy denominator,
and we have divergence.
So I want to show you now, partly
also for the beauty of the physical theory,
How can we deal?
How can we fix those divergences?
How can we fix those infinities we encounter
in perturbation theory?
The answer will be we get rid of these infinities
by summing up an infinite number of diagrams.
So I want to show you now it's actually
sounds so much more harder than it is, however,
with a rather modest mathematical effort
we can perform an infinite sum over diagrams.
And, I want to show you what those diagrams are.
And the result of that is that the divergences disappear
and we have a valid description of what happens when atoms
encounter resonant radiation.
So, I'm following here, almost religiously, the Atom-Photon
Interaction book.
So, this introduction it's a summary of those pages.
So, when we discussed diagrams, we
wanted to figure out what is the amplitude for a system
to go from an initial to a final state.
And those where the matrix elements of the T-matrix,
a transition matrix.
And, if we do it in second order,
well, remember, the structure is in second order.
We sort of emit a photon virtual or real.
We have another photon, this gives a second order.
And in between the system propagates with its ion energy.
If we-- so, this was the structure of the diagrams
we had.
And, this term here, let's expand it
in wave functions of the unperturbed Hamiltonian.
And, then we obtain this following structure.
So this is just rewriting in a very suggestive way
what we had discussed before.
And, the case I focus on now is the interaction
of atoms with the resonant light.
Because, this is when we have divergences.
If we have state A state B, we have a laser,
and we scatter light, if the frequency is
approximately resonant, then, those perturbative results
have a divergency.
So, for resonant light scattering the typical matrix
element we are interested in, restart and end of course
in the current state.
We scatter photon we go up to an excited state
and go back to the current state.
But, we start initially with a photon of reflector k
and polarization epsilon.
And, this may be difficult for the scattered light.
The interaction happens by the interaction operator.
Which, for the purpose of this discussion
can either be a or p term, or the d dot e term.
We've discussed about this special whole
of the a squared term, we've discussed it earlier.
I don't want to include that in the discussion right now.
And, then, you would say--
I just want to make sure they do not confuse the in second order
perturbation theory you always have an energy denominator.
But, as I also explained to you the energy denominator
comes from the free propagator.
You have it you had a dot propagate and a dot
and what is the time evolution of this free propagation when
you integrate it with time this gave rise
to the energy denominator.
Just a side remark.
So, we should be very familiar that we have an energy
denominator, but now this energy denominator,
the initial energy is the initial atomic state
plus the photon.
And then, if you want to sum over all states,
I can just put in here the operator h0,
but you may it immediately you think about it,
the only state which really matters is a state b
and there will be--
And what matters is only when we go for the intermediate state b
then each node is eb.
And then we have a divergence because the denominator
is zero.
So, let's see how we can fix it.
But, let me first give you the perturbative result. Which,
you have seen many, many times.
It is the product of two matrix elements.
We have an intermediate state, the excited state
without photon.
We started with a photon and we end up with a photon
until we have our dipole or a.p term.
And our energy denominator diverges
when the frequency of the photon approaches the resonance
frequency.
Well, how can we fix it.
You know that in many cases you are just
adding an imaginary part to it.
Which reflects that due to the coupling
with the vacuum of the electromagnetic field
the excited state is supporting it.
And it gives its energy an imaginary part.
This of course is a very phenomenological
but at least technically, technically,
it avoids the divergence.
Now, what I want to show you is in the next 15 minutes
and we continue on Wednesday, is how
I can get this result of a very rigorous approach.
I want to use a diagrammatic approach.
I want to sum an infinite number of diagrams.
And I will tell you what are the approximations to get this.
For instance, as you know when you have an imaginary part when
you have just imaginary part of the energy the physics of it
is exponential decay.
Well, I hope, not today but on Wednesday,
you will realize what assumptions
lead to exponential decay.
And that in principle non-exponentially decay
is rather the standard than the exception.
But, the effects are small.
But, I sort of want to show you.
So in some sense I want to give when
we have to go for a half an hour of work to derive this result.
So I would say what's about it you just get
the phenomenological result?
Well, we obtain we have put it on a rigorous basis
and number two is we do understand
what assumptions really go into this phenomenological result.
So, that the way how we will actually obtain this result
is that the second order diagram is that--
you start in state a you go in state b
and you are back in state a and you exchange photons.
So, the physical picture we want to use now
is after the photon is absorbed, right here,
the system is not propagating with the Hamiltonian H0.
It will propagate with the Hamiltonian h.
If we do that, then we avoid the divergence
we get a result which can be applied to the formulas
can be applied to many situations.
And in one limiting case we obtain that.
So the physics behind is following-- the resonance so
where divergence, which we encounter in resonant physics,
is only a divergence because we assume the atom in state B
is naked.
It's an excited state of an isolated atom.
But in reality, the state b interacts
by virtual photon emission interacts
with all the nodes of the vacuum.
And once before that in, by saying,
that between absorbing and emitting a photon the state
b propagates, not with the free Hamiltonian,
but with the total Hamiltonian, we avoid the divergence.
But this is no longer a perturbative result.
And let me sort of illustrate it to you.
If you take the energy denominator
omega minus omega 0.
And we add the imaginary part to it.
I can Taylor expand that, assuming the imaginary part
is small.
Well, that's sort of a trivial expansion
but now you should know that gamma,
the rate of spontaneous emission, the simplest
expression is obtained in Fermi's golden rule,
in the second order, in the interaction Hamiltonian.
Spontaneous emission is proportional
to the atomic dipole matrix element squared.
So it's second order in the Hamiltonian.
But, that means that this harmless addition
of an imaginary part, means, if you now look at the Taylor
expansion that we have--
that, we are using now infinite orders--
infinite orders in this expansion.
So the phenomenological addition of bits gamma
to the excited level b is actually highly non-trivial.
Because it corresponds technically or physically
to a non-perturbative result, which
involves infinite order in the interaction matrix element.
Question about it?
So, this is more setting up the agenda.
I wanted to remind you of the perturbative result.
I want to sort of show you how we can fix it.
I want to show you what it means.
But, with that motivation, I want to go now to, back to,
our diagrammatic approach, our former solution,
our exact formal solution of the time evolution of a quantum
system, and show you how I can implement
this agenda in particular by not allowing the atom to propagate
with a naked Hamiltonian H0.
But sort of staying dressed with photons
and propagating with the Hamiltonian H. Questions
about that?
