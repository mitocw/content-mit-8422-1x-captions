Now, I want to show you how you can take care of all dimensions
with one equation and not solve three
different equations with three different, you know,
kinetic energy terms.
That goes as follows, you recognize that this is just
Schrodinger's equation.
Kinetic energy minus energy equals potential.
But now, we can Fourier transform it.
And the nice thing about Fourier transformation
is that the second derivative is simply--
spatial derivative is simply q squared.
So therefore, if you perform--
if you have describe now everything in Fourier space,
you have q squared plus k squared times psi,
but you divide by q squared plus k squared.
Here, you have a product.
The product turns into convolution.
Anyway, it may be not the most familiar way you have seen it,
but this is just Schrodinger's equation in Fourier components.
And now, we want to simplify that we have a short range
potential.
So we assume we have a short range potential.
If you had a delta function, the momentum components
of the potential would be constant for all r.
But we get into something unphysical
if we don't put in a cutoff, so we put in a cutoff.
But with that cutoff, you can rewrite the equation
as follows.
And now, we want to do one thing.
We want to integrate over q.
Then on the right-hand side, we also have an integral over q.
And then, we divide by the common factor, and what we get
is this.
I know I'm going fast, but this is
nothing else than rewriting Schrodinger's equation for you.
But now, look at it.
It says it has an integral over all energies with the density
of states or of E, of energy.
E is k squared.
This is the energy of the bound state.
And we want the bound state.
And on the left-hand side, we have
our infinitesimal potential.
I mean, one thing is clear.
If you have an infinitesimal potential,
you can only get an infinitesimally bound state.
So now, we do the following.
If you go to an infinitesimal attraction,
the left-hand side diverges.
And the question is now if the energy goes to zero,
does the right-hand side diverge or not?
In other words, if this integral where you said E equals zero
does not diverge, you cannot fulfill this equation with
an infinitesimal attraction in the square value potential.
So therefore, the condition for a bound state
is now that this expression here with E equals zero diverges.
And this combines now all cases.
And you have now an integral equation.
And you can now solve it for infinitesimal V naught.
V naught you can solve it.
What is the energy as a function of V naught?
And in two dimensions, when the density of states versus energy
is constant, you have the weakest divergence
on the right-hand side.
It's a logarithmic divergence.
In three dimensions, this doesn't diverge.
In one dimension, it diverges big time.
Two dimensions is the limit.
There's a logarithmic divergence.
And if you do the math-- which is elementary,
but I'm not doing it--
you'll find that the energy of the bound state
depends exponentially on minus 1 over the attraction.
So for infinitesimal attraction, this turns to E
to the minus infinity.
It's the weakest bound state you can imagine.
