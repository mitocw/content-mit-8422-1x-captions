In this chapter, we want to look at interactions
between light and atoms using Feynman diagrams.
And I know this part of the course is a little bit formal.
We are using exact solutions for the time evolution
operator in quantum physics.
But I'm not doing it to teach you sophisticated formalism.
Well, it's interesting to learn it anyway.
But it is this picture of really writing down
the exact solution of the time evolution operator
which helped me to understand much better what
virtual states are, what certain virtual photons are.
So there are things we talk about it all the time.
And the question is, how do you define a virtual state?
What is the virtual emission of a photon?
And the only way how I can really
explain it to you is by showing you the equation
and say, look, the virtual photon
is just a term in this equation.
So, that's the goal of this chapter.
I don't want to over emphasize a mathematical rigor,
but I want to really show you what
it means to have virtual photons and that what exactly
virtual states are.
So let me first motivate that by reminding you of two diagrams.
In physics, we always like to draw something,
a few lines a few doodles.
And when we have a two level system,
we have the two processes which are emission and absorption.
Well, so this is easy as long as the light is in resonance.
But if the light is not in resonance,
we may ask, what about this process?
And since somehow the wiggly of the photon ends here,
I may even put in a dashed line and say,
this is a virtual state.
What does that mean?
Or we can even ask, is it possible--
I'm just playing with straight lines which are quantum state
and wiggly lines--
is it possible that this process happens?

That would actually mean that an atom in the ground state just
out of the blue emits a photon.
Can that happen?
And I can again draw a dashed line
and say, here is a virtual state.

Or we can say we start in the excited state.
The atom is in the excited state.
But can the atom--
it's a two level system so we don't include higher states--
but can a two level atom in the excited state
absorb another photon?
Good.
So question is, are those processes possible?

Yes or no?
Yes.
Yes, they are.
And they have experimental observable consequences.
However, they look funny because something seems to be strange
here with energy conservation.
And what we will see is that in the end, the end of the day--
that means if we have an-- if we let the system evolve
for a long time--
after a long time, energy has to be conserved.
And therefore, we will always need a second photon
to conserve energy.
So those weirder processes where photons
are emitted by ground states out of the blue or excited states
absorb other photons without--
also, there is no higher lying state.
That looks a little bit strange but with--
so what you will see is--
and I want to show you that mathematically--
if an atom emits a photon out of the ground
state, where does the energy come from?
But quantum mechanic allows us to violate energy conservation
by an amount, delta E, for a time which
is h bar over delta E. So for a short moment,
energy can be violated.
But then you need the second photon
to reconcile energy conservation.
You can violate energy only for short times.
And if you would say, what does it really
mean to violate energy conservation for a short time
spell, I want to show you the equation which
exactly explains what it means.

Next question, just to see--
if you have an excited state and you just
say it's possible to absorb another atom,
you are in the excited state and you absorb another photon.
And at least you said yes, this is possible.
My question is, when you are in the excited state
and absorb a photon, in which quantum state is the atom
after absorbing a photon?
[INAUDIBLE]
Pardon?
[INAUDIBLE]
In the calm state.
Yes.
There is no other state.
And the operator-- and I want to show you that--
when photons are exchanged, all this transforms the ground
to the excited state.
Because a dipole operator connects the ground
to the excited state.
So therefore, but we'll see that all
in the time evolution operator in the formal solution
that this dashed line is actually the ground state.
And while it's not obvious, what is this dashed line?
The excited state.
It is the excited state.
The atom in the ground state emits a photon.
Therefore, the atomic system has now
lower energy because the photon has been emitted.
But the character of this state is now the excited state.

So we will later see that this means
that in a perturbation analysis, we are violating energy.
We are violating energy because the real excited
state is omega photon plus omega atom, the resonant energy
for the atom.
The real excited state is omega photon plus omega atom higher.
So you will actually find that in a perturbation analysis,
this term has an energy denominator, which
is off resonant by exactly this separation.
And this term, because of the real calm state is here,
the virtual state here, which is accounted, is here,
has actually the same energy denominator as that state.
And for this state, of course, this
is something you've seen in off resonant light scattering,
the energy dominator is that.

So I have explained to you that we involve virtual states.
So when we have virtual states, we
want to clarify, what is the energy?
But we discussed that already in the discussion.
And what the wave function, ground or excited state?
