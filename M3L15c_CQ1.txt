But if no photon is observed, I want to give you three choices.
And you should address them with the clicker.
One choice is that the particle stays in the same state.
The second choice is that the particular stays
in a superposition state, but the probability
to be in the excited state decays.
Also, no photon has been emitted or no photon has been observed.
And the third possibility is something else.
So in other words, assume you are an observer.
And you know with 100% detection probability,
let's not discuss technical issues.
You have completely surrounded your system
with perfect detectors.
And you know in the timestep delta-t,
no photon was observed.
And now, you should make a prediction what happens next
to the quantum system and you make the prediction
by assuming that the system is described by a wave function
or density matrix.
And I'm asking you which of the three choices
correctly describes what this system will do afterwards.
What the system will do next.
Is the question very clear?
Good.
