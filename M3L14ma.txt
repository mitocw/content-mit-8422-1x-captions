So the question is about the master creation.
We know that the most general master creation
has to have the Lindblad form.
And the Lindblad form has a jump operator,
which is providing dissipation.
In its simplest case, a jump operator
is just a sigma minus operator for spontaneous emission, which
takes us from the excited state to the ground state.
And when we had the Lindblad form, the jump operator--
and it's [INAUDIBLE] conjugate, like sigma plus, sigma minus,
appear on the right hand side of the master equation
with the statistical operator here, here, and in the middle.
They are plus minus signs in factors of 2.
So I don't have an intuitive explanation
of where the factors come from.
They come from the derivation, but-- do you
have a question about it, Nancy?
So after writing the Lindblad form,
we get gammas, which we are saying for the [INAUDIBLE]
vector, we were writing [INAUDIBLE] gammas
in the [INAUDIBLE], and we [INAUDIBLE].

Yes.

So let's go right here.
That's actually what we were going to discuss today is.
We want to discuss today solutions of the optical Bloch
equations.
And just to remind you, we derived a master that equation,
master equation for the density matrix.
And this master equation, through the interaction
with a reservoir, is acting a term
to the Hamiltonian evolution.
And this is shown in red here.
These are the interactions with the reservoir.
And in the case of the optical Bloch equation
and spontaneous emission, we have
only one Lindblad operator, which
is Lindblad operator sigma minus for spontaneous emission.
So this here is the master equation
for the two level system interacting with a vacuum
through spontaneous emission.
And by substituting the two level density matrix
has three non-trivial components.
Sure, it's a two by two matrix, but the trace is one.
And so we can transform from the matrix elements of the density
matrix to the other coefficient, which come in very handy,
because they allow a simple geometric Lindblad [INAUDIBLE],
and this is the Bloch vector.
And so the master equation, which is shown here,
turns into a differential equation for the Bloch vector.
And those two equations are identical.
We've just undo substitution.
But your question is now about--
[INAUDIBLE]
Because we have negative gamma over 2,
which is from the first and last term.
But the gamma [INAUDIBLE].
This one here?
No.
This one?
Yes.
That's negative gamma over 2 times negative 2.
No.
I mean, first of all, this is a differential equation
for r dot.
r dot-- OK.
This is a differential equation for the Bloch vector.
And we have here three different relaxation
rates, which are gamma, gamma over 2, and gamma over 2.
And they are all negative, because they're
relaxation rates.
This here not a prefector of r.
It is sort of a constant.
And it means, in the long time limit, I mean,
what happens if you have a system which spontaneously
decays after a while?
The r vector is not 0.
The r vector is hanging down.
The system is in its ground state.
And this is exactly that.

Wait, am I r dot?

Yes, the fact is, the system, the differential equation
has to relax towards the equilibrium.
You can actually rewrite this equation r dot equals a matrix
times r minus r equilibrium.
So here is the matrix, the matrix
of the optical Bloch equation.
So if you rewrite that that r dot is the matrix times r
minus r equilibrium, then r equilibrium times
the matrix gives something constant,
and this is exactly this here.
But it's a mathematical identity.
Just look at it.
There is no assumption.
It's an exact rewriting of the equation.

So it is this creation which will
be in the focus of our attention, not only today,
but also when we talk about light forces.
The first thing we did is we wanted
to discuss the Mollow triplet.
And just as a reminder, we have talked about,
at the beginning of last class, we
talked about the fluorescence.
An atom is excited by monochromatic laser light.
And at low intensity, it simply emits--
a delta function emits exactly the same frequency
of light, which is provided by the laser light.
So the incoming and outgoing photons
have exactly the same frequency.
And this is simply a consequence of energy conservation.
But at higher intensity, we have sidebands
and we understand intuitively that we have sidebands
because the system a Rabi oscillation.
So same classically, we have an emitter,
which has some modulation, and that creates sidebands.
But what's rather easy to understand
is by diagonalizing the two-by-two matrix,
we find that we have a splitting of excited state with n photons
and ground sigma with n plus 1 photons.
So we have sort of a plus and minus state.
And if you look at the possible transitions,
we immediately find the explanation
for the Mollow triplet.
There are three different frequencies
which can be emitted between transitions
between three states.
What is much more subtle, what cannot be obtained from
a perturbative treatment is the [INAUDIBLE],
how wide are those peaks in the Mollow triplet?
And there is tens and tens of pages
in atom-photon interaction.
But at least for two limiting cases,
I could show you what the bits of the peak is by first seeing,
if you have delta equals c or ng equals 0, the matrix, which
determines the dynamics, has three eigenvalues, gamma
over 2, gamma over 2, and gamma.
And now, if we detune, we add a rotation along z.
If we drive the system strong, it
corresponds to a rotation around x.
You probably remember from 8421 the spin in the magnetic field.
It rotates with its frame rotating with omega.
It rotates at the detuning delta.
But if you derive it, we make it flip along the x-axis.
So we find exactly that here.
And then, it's an intuitive way to solve the matrix
if you want solve the matrix mathematically.
But intuitively, what happens is, if you have a z rotation,
we don't change this eigenvalue.
And the rotation is just adding i omega.
Omega is the rotation to x and y,
because x and y are now rotating.
So therefore, we obtained that, in the case of detuning
the z rotation, we have minus gamma,
minus over 2, minus gamma over 2.
And here, what appears here is the rotation frequency.
And then, if you rotate around the x-axis, then of course,
nothing happens.
But what used to be the x-axis, so we get one eigenvalue
with minus gamma over 2.
But the y and z eigenvectors are rotated.
And hand-wavingly, I can tell you.
But you can show it mathematically
that this means the two new eigenvectors have the average
of those two damping terms.
And this is 3/4 gamma.
So at least for the two cases for large detuning
and strong drive, I was, with a little bit of intuition,
showing you and deriving for you where
the non-trivial bits of the Mollow triplet comes from.
So I hope you are least impressed
that these optical Bloch equations are powerful
and allow us to make predictions which would be
difficult to obtain otherwise.
Any questions about that?
About the Bloch vector, the differential equation,
and the spectrum of the emitted light?
