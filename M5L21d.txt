We want to talk about quantum computation with ions.
H1 has a wonderful write up on the wiki
on the basic concept of quantum computation, and how it--
how it applies to ions.
But let me immediately jump to qubit operations.
I mean you've heard many, many times that a general trend two
algorithm can be constructed out of single qubit
rotations and two qubit--
two qubit gates.
Single qubit rotations are just oscillations
on the Bloch sphere.
If you excite a particle, move it around on the Bloch sphere,
this is how you can to see the qubit from ground state
to excited state, any possible superposition state.
So the physics of single atoms, Rabi oscillation,
rotation on the Bloch sphere, this is all you
have to know about center qubit operations.
The interesting thing is, how to recreate two qubit operations.
And two qubit operations would mean
you want to do something to one ion here, depending what
the state of the other ion is.
And this is much more subtle.
So what I want to explain to you now
is the famous Cirac-Zoller gate, which was really
a pioneering paper which has thousands of citations
now, because it showed that quantum computation can
be experimentally realized in a rather straightforward way.

It's a fundamental theorem of quantum information processing,
that if you have similar qubit operations and one
2-qubit gate, which is a C-not gate,
that this is a universal set of quantum gates.
Any arbitrary quantum algorithm can be constructed out
of those gate operations.
So let me just remind you what the c-not gate is.
We have qubits, ion one, ion two, they can be in 0 or in 1.
This can be two different hyperfine states,
or in the case of the calcium ion,
it can be the ground state or meta-stable excited state.
Just two different states of ion one two different states
of ion two.
The C-not gate would now say the following,
the first ion is the control bit.
And whenever the control bit is 1
it flips the qubit, the second qubit, if the control bit is 0,
it does not it does--
it does nothing to second ion.
So therefore, the table which shows how the quantum states
perform is 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1.
It just shows that I'm writing down the matrix in this space,
it's a 2's table--
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1.
And it shows that when you have 1, 1 at the input,
you get 1, 0 at the output.
If you have 1, 0 at the input, you get 1, 1 at the output.
Well, the two-- the two qubit gate I want to discuss,
which has been realized with--
which can be realized with a simple--
in the simplest possible way of the Cirac-Zoller algorithm,
is the controlled phase qubit, which has a 2's table of 1,
1, 1, minus 1.
And it means when--

it simply changes the face of the 2-qubit states
when both qubits are one.

Now this C-not gate can be constructed out
of the controlled phase gate by having two--
two similar qubit rotations done with the Hadamard gate,
the Hadamard gate is taking the bases 1 and 2, and creates 1
plus 2, 1 minus 2, the symmetric and anti-symmetric
superposition state.
So therefore, the c-phase gate is
as general as the c-not gate, because one can
be used to construct the other.
