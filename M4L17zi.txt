Now, how can we achieve sub-Doppler cooling?
Sub-Doppler cooling was discovered in 1988.
And I remember, I was at the [? ICA ?] Conference in Paris
when Bill Phillips's group said, we've carefully
measured the temperature.
And in sodium, we measured a temperature
which is lower than the Doppler limit, which
was rigorously derived.
I derived for you with the Doppler limit of molasses.
So what went wrong here?
Well, it became clear the only loophole--
if you have a theory that predicts something
and then you find a violation, you carefully
have to check the assumption.
And the assumption which was made
and which we have made in this course
is that we were a two-level system.
Now, atoms have hyperfine structure.
And for pedagogical reasons-- because I want to explain you
one sub-Doppler cooling scheme--
I assume this hyperfine structure with F equals 1/2,
F equals 3/2.
But let me first tell you what is the novel
feature about a multilevel atom which is hyperfine structure.
Now, the one thing which happens is
that instead of just going between our single ground
state and our single excited state,
we now have transitions--
you may want to call them Raman transitions
or optical pumping--
between the hyperfine levels.
So there are now transitions not only up to an excited
state, which rapidly decays.
There are now transitions--
Raman transitions-- between ground states,
which have a very low widths.
The width of the excited state is gamma.
Well, what is the width of the ground state?
Well, if you don't have a laser beam, the width is 0.
But if you have laser beams, the atom
doesn't stay there forever.
There will be a time, which is estimated here--
depending on the Rabi frequency and the detuning,
this is the time.
This is simply nothing else than the scattering
rate, which we derived before.
So that's the rate at which you scatter photons.
And then, depending what the branching ratio is,
this is also the time in which you may optically
pump to another ground state.
So therefore, what we have to take into account now
is that we have narrower widths in our system.
And those widths correspond to another two-level system,
which is driven by two photons and which
connects the two ground states.
I will not give you any derivation, how this exactly
leads to lower temperature.
But I want to give you two pictures, which I have already
introduced to you.
One is-- remember when we discussed Doppler cooling,
the finer temperature was proportional to gamma,
the width of the transition.
So now, I'll wave my hands and say,
if you have transitions between ground states, which
have a much, much smaller width, which is
the rate of optical pumping--
and for low laser power, these widths
can become very, very narrow--
that you have at least one ingredient which
can lead to lower temperature.
OK, in all truth, in advertising for the Sisyphus
for the polarization gradient cooling scheme,
the final temperature is not given by gamma prime,
the rate of optical pumping.
It is a proportionality factor.
But there is another factor.
If you want to learn about it, you
have to read some of the classic papers.
But there is another picture, which
I can also use to tell you--
and it's actually related--
why optical pumping at least gives the possibility
for lower temperature.
I explained to you, with the stimulated force
in [INAUDIBLE] molasses, that the only reason
why we have cooling is that the atom has a lag time.
It cannot instantaneously adjust itself to the light field.
It lags behind.
And you can say, in Doppler cooling,
the lag time is the spontaneous emission time.
And the inverse of it is gamma.
Here, in this case, the lag time can be the very long time
to optically pump.
So therefore, if the atom is in one hyperfine state and now
moves into an area where the polarization of the laser beams
is different, it may take a long time to adjust.
And it is this lag time to which the friction coefficient
was proportional.
So this is a new feature, long delay times,
narrow widths in resonances between ground-state levels.

OK, a little bit show and tell now--

nobody thought about polarization gradient cooling.
Nobody thought about Doppler cooling.
But it was discovered when people simply
did Doppler molasses.
And it's one of those big violations of Murphy's law
where cooling worked much better than everybody had thought.
And the result is the following.
That, when I drew for you the blue curve, which
is force versus velocity--
it's pretty much the subtraction of two [INAUDIBLE]--
what happened is, for sodium atoms or for any alkali atom,
is the red curve.
For large velocity, you have the Doppler cooling mechanism.
But for smaller velocities, you have, sort of,
a steepening of the slope.
And steeper the slope, the larger
is your friction coefficient alpha.
