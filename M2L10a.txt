Our next section is Van der Waals interactions.
The chapter on Van der Waals interaction
is quite interesting for the following reason.
It really tells us something about the vacuum.
I think modern physics has come to the conclusion
that the vacuum is one of the most interesting subjects
to study because the vacuum is alive.
It's filled by virtual photons, virtual particles,
and as we know now, by a condensate of Higgs boson.
So there is a lot of stuff, a lot of structure,
a lot of phenomena associated in the vacuum.
And the subject of Van der Waals interactions
is a nice way to talk about the vacuum
but it's nice also for the following reason.
There is a completely I would say semi-classical way.
Just use the Schrodinger equation
and calculate what is the Van der Waals
interaction between two atoms.
So we can just calculate a perturbation theory
and in your whole calculation, you never
use the quantized electromagnetic field.
Photons never appear.
You just use perturbation theory and you
do that in your homework.
It's quite straightforward and you get a Van der Waals
interaction.
On the other hand, I started to derive for you
the theory of the quantized electromagnetic field
by saying we really look at everything.
We have charges and we have the electric and magnetic field
and we described everything.
And the way how we separate it is we
had this Hamiltonian H0, which gives us the atom.
And the longitudinal Coulomb field became part of it
so this is the degree of freedom of the atom.
And we have H0 for the other atom.
And then we had the radiation field and the coupling
to the atom described by our operator v, which
can be the dipole operator or can be written down
in other gauges.
But what I'm telling you is the way how we have fundamentally
divided the world into atoms, atoms,
neutral objects, and the rest is interactions with a radiation
field, that should tell you that the Van der Waals
interaction between two atoms must have a description in QED
where the Van der Waals interaction between atoms
comes from the exchange of photons.

So there are two very simple pictures and the same physics.
One is you don't even know that they are photons.
You just do perturbation theory.
But in a more comprehensive description
where we include the photons, you
should be able to understand the Van der Waals
interaction between two atoms due to the exchange
of virtual photons.
In other words, one atom is in the ground state--
emits a photon.

That's going down from the ground state.
But until now, if we have only one atom,
it has to re-absorb the photon again and be back
in the ground state.
Otherwise, energy would be violated.
But if we have two atoms, one atom
can emit a photon and the other atom can absorb it
and then the other atom can send the photon back.
And if we consider that process, we
will actually find the Van der Waals interaction.
So I hope this is showing interesting physics from two
angles, that something which looked maybe
trivial a long time ago now looks much, much richer
because those forces are really mediated by virtual photon
pass.
So that's the discussion I want to go through.
There is another aspect to it and this
is when we go from the Van der Waals force
to the Casimir force.
The Casimir force has one exact derivation,
which I want to share with you, which relates the Casimir
force to the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field.
So eventually, for those forces between two metal plates,
a neutral atom and a plate, two neutral atoms,
we will have three different pictures.
One is we use a semi-classical dipole field
as a perturbation operator.
You don't think about it.
It's trivial and you check it off in your homework.
The second one is you look at the exchange
of virtual photons.
And the third one is you only look
at the zero-point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field.
What is real here?
What causes it?

We'll see.
