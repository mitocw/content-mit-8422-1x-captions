Let me now take this Bose-Hubbard model
and discuss it's two limiting cases.
One case is where U is much larger than J.
The other case is where J is much larger than U.
These are the two limiting cases and it
will turn out that one is an insulator
and one is a superfluid.
I mean, that makes perfect sense of course.
If U is much larger than J I can set J equal to zero
if I can neglect it.
No tunneling mean no transport and that means an insulator.
It's also clear that when there is no tunneling
that the system is really described
by a product of so and so many particles per side.
So it could be one particle per side,
and have a product of over all the sides,
or two particles per side.
So this would be the ground state
and it's called the ground state of thermal insulator.
It's also trivial to discuss what
happens if J is much, much larger
than U, because then I simply neglect U.
And I have a free gas, well, a free gas of block wave
function, but that is the same as a free gas of planer wave
function.
It's just that quasi-momentum replaces momentum.
And if you have just an ideal Boser
gas in a periodic lattice instead
of Bose-Einstein condensation in the lowest momentum state,
you have Bose-Einstein condensation in the lowest
quasi-momentum state.
The lowest quasi-momentum state is a superposition
of all Wannier functions.
I mean the zero momentum state in free space
is a superposition of all delta functions,
of all position delta functions.
The plane wave is delocalized.
And the lowest quasi-momentum state
is just completely delocalized over all Wannier functions.
But this is nothing else than the Q equal
zero quasi-momentum block wave.
The interesting question is, and this
has led to 100s if not more papers in the literature, how
do we go from one limit to the other limit.
And now you would say, well, maybe we
should use what has worked so well.
We should use the Bogoliubov approximation,
just as soon we have a condensate,
replace all those kind of zero operators for the lowest block
waves.
However, this doesn't work.
Because the interesting thing here
is to find the transition from the superfluid
from the Bose-Einstein condensate
to an insulating state.
The nature of this approximation is
that you need N naught to be large,
but we're interested in the number-- when
the condensate wave function turns
to zero and in the insulator it becomes zero.
So we're actually interested in the opposite limit.
And indeed, if you would ignore everything
I've just said, that it doesn't make sense
to make this approximation, and make it nevertheless,
you will find that you never get the insulating state,
because you've pretty much eliminated the possibility
to reduce carbon in insulating state
by doing this approximation.
So I want to show you now that we
have to do another mean field approximation, which
is actually nice.
It has-- it's a very different from this Bogoliubov
approximation, but it's also mean field approximation
which will describe our system.
So the goal is now that I want to find
an effective Hamiltonian, which describes the transition
from here to there.
And the important approximation I will use is the following.
Again, I have to get rid of operators.
Products of too many operators cannot be solved.
And so what I will do is I will use products of operators,
write them as average value plus fluctuations.
And then when I multiply that out,
I take the product of the average values
and I include the fluctuations in leading order.
So I take delta A times B and delta B times A average,
but I neglect the product of those fluctuations.
You can say I neglect the correlation of fluctuations
here.
So this is spelled out here.
But since I want you--
the sign is important.
Just look at this equation, 8 delta
B plus delta B with B plus A average times B average.
If I up-- if I absorb A times B by upgrading delta B to B,
but I do the same here, I have to subtract one product
of the two average values.
Its actually this minus sign with
which will play a role later, but here you see already
that I went and made this decoupling approximation,
that I decoupled the fluctuations from each other.
And I write it in this way.
There is an important minus sign.

OK.
So we want to start in the insulating state
and want to figure out how does this system develop superfluity
out of the insulating state.
And the perturbation operator which takes me out
of the insulating state is tunneling.
So therefore the operator, which is responsible of breaking out
of the insulating state is the operator
which induces tunneling between neighboring sides.
And the tunneling operator in this Hamiltonian,
remember the Bose-Hubbard model had J times B dega
B this was our tunneling term, this involves now products
of operators.
And I told you we want to get rid of products of operators
to get something we can easily solve.
So we use now this product of operators
on two neighboring sides.
And we use exactly this decoupling approximation.
So therefore, we replace each operator by an average value
and we neglect the product of the fluctuations.
And then we obtain this.
And I've explained to you where minus sign came from.
So now I call this average value of the operator
B-L I call the superfluid order parameter psi
I think I could have chosen side to be complex
and then B-L dega B-L would have complex conjugate,
but it is sufficient here to restrict
the discussion on real numbers and it makes the notation
simpler.
So anyway, so I introduce that.
And what happens now is the following,
that I have my Hamiltonian.
The Hamiltonian had the interaction energy.

But the tunneling term is now very simplified,
because instead of tunneling from one side
to a neighboring side, the other side
is sort of absorbed by the mean field,
by the superfluid order parameter psi.
And therefore, and this gives me a psi squared
term which appears here, trust me
this is just an identical rewrite
of the previous Hamiltonian by using this decoupling
approximation.
So well what we want to-- what we have gained
now is something really dramatic.
We had, sort of, many sides and tunneling from side to side.
But if you look at it now, we simply multiply the effective
Hamilton-- we take--
we sum the effective Hamiltonian over side index L.
So our effective Hamiltonian is now
the sum of an identical Hamiltonian per side.
The sites no longer interact with each other.
Each side interacts with all the other sides
described by the mean field by the superfluid order parameter
psi.
So therefore our many body problem,
which is still a many body problem,
but has turned into an effective Hamiltonian for each side,
because each side has the same Hamiltonian.
Colin.
What happened to the J psi squared?
This here?
Oh OK, sorry.

OK.
So here is now, so I can say instead of solving for the sum,
I can just solve for each side individually.
And this is now my effective Hamiltonian for each side.

Now, I want to catch at the onset of superfluity,
so I want to get the system when psi is smaller.
And therefore I can just ask.
I don't know what psi is.
It's part of my solution.
But I'm interested in the moment when
psi begins to take off from zero,
when superfluidity emerges.
So what I can therefore do is I can regard psi as an epsilon
parameter as a small parameter.
And the psi parameter comes with an operator V.
And this operator V is nothing else
than B-L dega plus B-L. So in other words, what I'm doing
is I'm separating my Hamiltonian into an Hamiltonian, which
is diagonal in the quantum numbers of the isolating state,
just one, two, three particles per side.
And psi squared is a C number that psi squared
can-- is also diagonal in that.
And now the possibility of tunneling, the possibility
of superfluidity is now perturbative in this term
psi times V. OK.
I don't want to explain actually this expression.
It just formalizes-- I need it as an immediate step.
When we have the chemical potential
and we raise the chemical potential,
we go from zero to one particles per side
to two particles are per side.
And whatever the chemical potential is
determines whether we have one or two particles per side.
This is just telling me as a function
of chemical potential, what is the ground
state of the insulator.
So now we take this ground state,
it's actually much easier described in words
than by this formula.
We take this ground state and do perturbation theory in our term
psi times V. Remember the operator is B dega B
and the epsilon is psi.
So in second order perturbation theory, we get psi squared.
And then V, because it's B-B dega.
It's very simple.
It only couples one side to the next.
It couples one occupation number N to N plus one
and N minus one, because B and B dega destroy
your created particle per side.
So therefore, I can immediately write down
what this matrix element is in second order perturbation
theory.
I mean these are all so-- it's all defined here.
I know I'm losing you now.
Nobody will tell me what is the difference between U bar and U,
but it's trivially defined.
So the idea is we have the isolating system,
we do perturbation theory and tunneling.
And the perturbative operator is psi times B plus B dega.
The B plus B dega matrix elements
are trivial, because it admix two N particles per side,
N plus 1 and N minus 1.
And this is what we've done here.
And the Js are just occupation numbers?
The J is the occupation number of our side.
OK, I guess two questions.
So in the bottom equation, what happened to the psi squared?
Sorry, this is the sum.
The psi squared is missing.
I guess it the same for the--
I had the same question for the equation
next to the green thing.
Is there supposed to be a psi squared in there?
Because originally there was a psi squared in the H-L.
No.
This is the ground state where psi is zero.
And know we do perturbation theory in psi V.
So we pretty much use-- these are
the unperturbed energies which appear in the energy
denominator.
The wave functions we are using all fox
states number states per side.
And here be couple occupation number J to all possible Ns,
but because of B and B dega, N has only two values, J plus one
and J minus one.
And this is what's giving here.

It's mathematically trivial.
