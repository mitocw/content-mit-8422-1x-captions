I want to now derive this situation for you for our atom
in a cavity.
And this is one example for the Quantum Zeno effect.
But let me explain to you what the quantum zero effect is.
Quantum zino is a Greek philosopher,
and the Greek philosophers had some deep thoughts
about the nature of time, the nature of motion.
And I think in the Greek philosophy,--
Sorry, but I don't have a strong background in philosophy.
But I think the idea is that motion
is when something moves around.
But it takes some time to move, so if you observe it,
it can't move because every time you observe it,
you localize something.
That's the idea.
If you see an arrow, the moment you observe it it's localized.
And if you localize something too often it cannot move.
This is sort of what you can see here.
The system wants to evolve to a second state.
But kappa can actually be a measurement process.
We can just shine a strong laser on this state and figure out,
has something arrived here?
And the more often we look, the stronger our measurement is,
the less the system can evolve.
So a measurement of what arrives in this state
slows down the dynamics to that state.
And this is called the Quantum Zeno effect.
It also goes by the name of Quantum Zeno paradox,
but it's just quantum mechanics, it's not a paradox.
In the popular world, it is sometimes paraphrased
as if you observe the tea kettle, the water never boils.
But what you see now where it comes from.
So this is a Quantum Zeno effect,
and by looking at the master equation
for an atom in a cavity, I want to show you
that you limit comes out of the master equation.
Questions about it?

So this is the Quantum Zeno effect.
And one of the nicest papers on the Quantum Zeno effect,--
I'm biased here-- was written by my group
because we used the Bose-Einstein condensate,
we had an RF coupling to another hyperfine state.
And then we used the laser beam and observed the population
in the final state.
We saw that the effect of the RF drive
became weaker, and weaker, and weaker, the stronger we
make the measurement in the final state.
This is a reference, and our work
was the first quantitative comparison.
You can now do a measurement by just
using a strong laser in maybe every millisecond or so.
Or you can use a weaker laser beam continuously.
So we show in this work that the Quantum Zeno
effect is the same--
whether you do a pulsed observation,
which is a strong measurement, or continuous weak measurement.
But let's now go back to the master equation.
So our job is now to solve this master equation for the limit
of strong damping.
And what we will find is both Quantum Zeno
effect, and-- another tidbit--, we
will also find the Purcell effect,
