You've done the hard work.
Now we want to have some fun discussing the physics.
I want to discuss three points.
One is I want to give you all the different pictures to find
the potential of a dipole trap, because we've
encountered several.
The second thing is I wanted to have a discussion with you
if they stimulated force due to electric or magnetic forces.
And eventually and so, if we are running out of time,
I have to do that on Wednesday to discuss the question
of energy conservation.
If you cool the atoms, where does the energy go?
If we use this stimulated force it
gives rise to dipole potential.
And using the optical Bloch equations or the dressed atom
picture, we found this expression
for the dipole potential.
And there are at least four ways how we could have derived it.
One is the optical Bloch equations.
We did that.
The dressed atom picture.
We did that today.

Another picture is very straightforward and simple.
It just says that the potential is the electric potential
of a dipole.
And then all you have to know is from the AC polarized ability,
if you drive an atom with a laser field below resonance,
I mean that's just a harmonic oscillator,
below resonance, the harmonic oscillator
is in phase with the force.
Above resonance, if you drive a harmonic oscillator fast,
the response of the harmonic oscillator is in opposite.
It's out of phase.
So therefore, if your potential is minus dE, you are in phase.
It is a negative attractive potential.
If the harmonic oscillator is driven above resonance,
there is another minus sign, you get
plus dE, which becomes the positive potential.
So you can say, just the physics of a harmonic oscillator.
There's one thing I like which is sometimes not taught
into an atomic physics course, because it
is a force on a macroscopic dielectric object.

So let's assume we have an atom, we don't have an atom.
We have something which is bigger.
Let's assume a tiny [INAUDIBLE] sphere,
or you can assume a small sphere of glass.
What happens if I shine a laser beam
on the small sphere of glass?
Well, let me assume that the laser beam is--
well, if the laser beam hits the sphere right on,
it's symmetric.
There is no force.
So what you want to do is we want
to have a laser beam, shown here by this arrow which
has a maximum here, so the profile is like this.
And you want to discuss whether the sphere is
sucked into the laser beam.
And this would be an attractive force.
Or whether this sphere is repelled.
And all we want to use is optics,
the optics of refraction.
When we have a laser beam which is a weak, medium, strong,
strong here, and for red detuning,
we have an index of refraction which is larger than one.
So this sphere acts like a lens.
So that means those photons are bent in,
and those photons are bent in.
And when a photon is bent in, the momentum of the photon
has changed.
And the momentum, of course the opposite momentum transfer
is imparted to the sphere.
So in this case, we have more photons
in this part of the laser beam, which are bent up than photons
are bent down.
And this means the net force is that this sphere is
sucked into the laser beam.
And if you go for blue detuned light,
where the index of refraction is smaller than one,
it is the opposite.
So the picture which we have discussed here
was for atoms for microscopic objects,
but you have actually similar physics over stimulated
force for mesoscopic and macroscopic objects.
And then what matters, whether you trap or anti-trap,
is whether the index of refraction is larger than 1
or smaller than 1.
And you know, two level systems for blue detuned light
have an index of refraction which is smaller than 1.
And for red detuned light, our atomic clouds
have an index of refraction which is larger than 1.
But this picture, that you can use the same set up,
the same focused beam and a similar dipole force
to trap larger objects is actually
exploited in a different field of physics,
in biology, in the form of optical tweezers.
When actually, in the early 80s, when Steve Chu
came to Bell labs and had discussions with Art Ashkin,
they actually discussed optical trapping
both of atoms, and both of biological objects,
little micro-spheres or cells.
And it's sort of remarkable that both approaches were
realized within the same year.
So atoms were trapped in '86, and macroscopic objects
were manipulated, I think it's exactly the same year.
And as you know, the optical tweezer
is now an important technology in biology, in biophysics.
For instance, you can focus a laser beam
