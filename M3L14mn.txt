So we have now a result for gamma cavity.
We have a result how the atom decays
in the presence of the cavity.

And I want to rewrite this for you in a very nice way.
Namely, I want to show you the famous result that when
an atom emits in a cavity that the atom can decay faster
than the spontaneous decay.
Because if the cavity has a resonance,
the cavity changes the vacuum around the vacuum.
It increases the density of modes,
and therefore there is a stimulation
of the atom into the cavity.
So I'm not-- I don't have any other math
than just rewriting our result of gamma cavity in other units,
in other ways.
And then we can compare it to the natural decay of an atom
without the cavity.
So what we want to do now is we want
to take the cavity induced decay of the excited state,
and we want to compare with the natural decay rate gamma.
So I just have to rewrite things in a few units.
The cavity induced decay is the vacuum
Rabi oscillations squared over kappa.
So let me remind you that the Rabi frequency is always
given by an dipole moment times electric field.
It's a matrix element.
Well, there's one of those factors of 2,
and each bar keeps the units correct.
And in the case of the vacuum, Rabi oscillation,
the electric field is the electric field, so to speak,
of one photon in the cavity volume.
And there's the factor of 2.
So this is now the volume of the cavity.
So therefore, the vacuum Rabi frequencies,
the dipole moment, times 2 atomic resonance frequency
epsilon 0 h bar v. And that means now,
and this is a nice result, that the cavity induced decay is
omega squared over kappa.
And I just use the above solid for omega 0.
And for kappa, I introduce the q factor
of the cavity, which is the number of oscillations
before it is damped.
It's omega over kappa.
And with that, I can rewrite the cavity induced decay
is 2 d squared, epsilon over h bar v times q.
And if you remember form part one
of the course, or standard textbook result,
that spontaneous decay is a dipole moment squared
times frequency to the power 3.
Then we obtain the famous result,
which is called the Purcell factor, namely
that the decay in the cavity compared
to the decay in free space is proportional to the q
of the cavity.
There is a numerical perfector but then what enters
is the wavelengths of the photon cubed over the volume.
So the case of eta larger than 1,
and it's actually interesting that this result
is completely independent of atomic properties.
So in other words, every atom you put in a cavity,
no matter what its dipole moment is,
it will decay with a rate that is q times larger.

There are many ways how to look at it.
You can say if the cavity consists of two mirrors,
you create q mirror images of your atom,
and you have sort of an atom, which
has a q times stronger dipole moment.
And therefore, because the mirror images also radiate,
and therefore, you get a q times faster decay.
So this limit makes sense in many, many different pictures.
And it's a general result that if an atom emits
in a cavity with [INAUDIBLE] q, you get the q times
enhancement of spontaneous decay.
So this is called cavity enhanced spontaneous emission.
It goes back to Purcell in 1946, and you
can see the whole field of cavity QED
depends on this effect, that you can enhance spontaneous decay,
or it's the opposite.
If an atom has a resonance frequency
between two modes of the cavity, the spontaneous decay
is inhabited.
And this is sort of what is exploited in cavity QED.

Let me just conclude here by saying
that our assumptions have to be consistent in our derivation.
We neglected gamma.
When I said the two link plot operators,
we only look at the leakage out of the photon.
We neglect spontaneous decay.
So of course, this requires that eta is larger 1.
So this is the consistent range of validity of our result.
Secondly, we discussed the limit of over damping,
which requires that kappa has to be larger than the vacuum Rabi
frequency.
And therefore the above result is valid for large q,
but q cannot be--
q has to be sufficiently large, but cannot be large in this
value.
Any questions?
Nancy.
For kappa, is that the loss of the cavity--
is there any difference between the losses of the cavity
because it's a cavity or the losses
into other modes of the cavity?
Kappa is the loss.
You can say kappa is the rate at which a photon in the cavity
is lost.
Is lost from the cavity completely,
or is into another mode inside the cavity?
Is there a difference?
With [INAUDIBLE] just one mode inside the cavity?
Well, we have not an element--
OK, if the mirror has imperfections,
we usually think of light leaking out of the mirror.
If the light is absorbing, because the coating has
a tiny little bit of absorption, you
know from the beam splitter analogy
that a small absorption means it's equivalent here
to small transmission factor.
Usually we don't consider that the light transforms
from one mode of the cavity to the other.
It's either absorbed or leaking out.
But if you assume that the mirrors are not super polished,
and they scatter light a little bit,
then you would have a mechanism that the light in the cavities
scatters into other modes.
And all those losses are summarized
in one coupling constant kappa.

Let me finish by showing to you the recent Nature
paper by the Innsbruck group.
We've talked so much about lint plot operators.
And the lint plot operators tells us,
the dissipation tells us what is the effect of the environment.
And usually you would say, well, if you have an atom
and it interacts with the environment,
what is sort of the equilibrium state?
Well, if you just have the vacuum,
the atom goes to the ground state,
and the ground state is the attractor,
the stable state of the system.
If you drive this system with one laser beam,
the attractor state, where the system goes into,
is the steady state solution of the optical Block equation.
That all sounds a little bit boring, but in this paper based
on his theoretical suggestion of Peter
Zoller, an experimental realization with tracked ions,
at Innsbruck, they actually engineered an environment,
engineered lint plot operators in such a way
that the system of two ions was relaxing into a Bell state.
So you engineer now the environment
that-- not I wanted to say thermal equilibrium-- no,
that the equilibrium state with the environment,
the dissipation leads to a Bell state.
Well, it's a little bit complicated how it is done,
but I just want to sort of just look
at a few highlighted key messages.
So the idea is here engineering of dissipation,
creating experimentally dissipative operators.
We usually manipulate quantum system with emission operators,
but here it is manipulated not by the h operator,
but by the l operator.
And so the idea here is to have an evolution of the density
matrix--
a linear mapping that the density matrix
evolves in a certain way.
I think you'll recognize partial trace.
You recognize a few equations, a few results
which we have discussed.
And what you see here is exactly lint plot form.
And what they did is by using a number of laser
beams in quantum operation, they designed
operators z, jump operators, lint plot operators
in such a way that the system was damping out
into a Bell state.
So that seems a new frontier for research.
That goes by the title that we can do quantum simulations
using trapped ions and core atoms of Hamiltonian's.
But we can also quantum simulate very special environments,
maybe environments in which it would be hard to find them
in nature, but they are quantum mechanically allowed,
possible environments.
And they may have new features which
have not been explored so far.
