Let me now talk about dephasing.
What I've shown you so far is how
we can unravel the density matrix
in many microscopic realizations.
And I've given you a specific example.
We assume probability for spontaneous emission
and with that we propagate our wave function.
But now I come to the nitty gritty details,
or the dirty truth, that what we have assumed is by no means
unique.
And I want to explain it to you first by reminding you
of a very, very nice homework assignment you have solved.
And this was about--
we have optical block equations for the density matrix.
And the solution of the optical block equation
is that we have population damping
with a damping time, t1.
And the off-diagonal matrix elements
are damped with a time, t2.
Remember, if we have only spontaneous emission,
t2 is 2 times t1.
But we can have a lot of other processes, which
can lead to a much, much faster dephasing
time than the time of population changes.
And in your homework, you have discussed three possibilities.
One is where spontaneous emission is energy loss.
But you have discussed three different possibilities for t2.

Three different possibilities how
dephasing, loss of coherence, and phase damping can happen.
And in this homework assignment, you
assumed either that there is a random phase,
that the elastic collision, which
project onto the excited state.
And then you got the most crazy and artificial model
that every time, randomly, the phase of the excited state
flips from plus to minus.
So if I would implement it now with a quantum Monte Carlo
method, it would have the following effect.
And I hope you enjoy the graphical representation.
You can really think about it, that this is what happens.
That this is what is inside the density matrix
described by this process.
So let's assume we have a system, which
would be in a superposition of ground and excited state.
And that would mean that in the lab frame,
the dipole moment would just rotate at the resonance
frequency.
It rotates, and it is a rotating dipole moment,
which emits coherent light.
But now you assume that you have a random phase.
So if you add random phases to it--
maybe because you have fluctuating magnetic fields--
then the line becomes sort of--
that doesn't look random, but you know what I mean--
it becomes sort of jagged.
The phase distribution is still sort of there,
but there is a jitter on top of it.
And as a result, the light emitted by this dipole
is spectrally [? broad. ?]
Well, in your second model, you assumed that with a certain
randomness, with a certain time constant,
there's an elastic collision in the excited state,
which [? put-- ?] [? shakes a ?] system into the excited state.
At this moment, there is no superposition state anymore
and the dipole moment is zero.
So that's what you assume.
Or when you have a random phase flips,
you assumed that suddenly this kind of deterministic sine
function suddenly jumps, corresponding to a minus
sign in the excited state.
And depending where you are in the cycle,
it creates jumps at random places.

And the question, of course, is if all those three processes--
and that's what you showed in your homework--
lead to the same density matrix, which one is correct?
Which one is real, is really realized,
in an experiment on a system which
is described by this kind of damping
or by the optical block equation?

So you can say all or none.
Well, you can assume what you want.
It doesn't make a difference.
