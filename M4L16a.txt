Today is a conceptually simple lecture,
because I'm not really introducing some subtleties
of quantum physics.
We know our Hamiltonian, the dipole Hamiltonian.
This is the fully quantized Hamiltonian,
how atoms interact with the electromagnetic field.
And of course, it's fully quantized
because E perpendicular is the operator
of the quantized electromagnetic field.
And it's the sum of a plus a dagger.
But when it comes to forces, it's actually fairly simple.
We don't introduce anything else.
This is our Hamiltonian.
This is the energy.
And the force is nothing else than the gradient
of this energy.
So I decided today--
it's rather unusual, but I will have everything pre-written,
because I think the concentration of new ideas
is not so high today.
So I want to go a little bit faster.
But I invite everybody of you, slow me down
if you think I'm going too fast, and if I'm skipping something.
Also, another justification is at least
the first 30%, 40% of the lecture you've already
done as a homework assignment when
you looked at the classical limit of mechanical forces.
You actually had already, as a preparation
for this class, a homework assignment
on the spontaneous scattering force and the stimulated dipole
force.
Well, the only subtlety today is,
how do we deal with a fully quantized
electromagnetic field?
But what I wanted to show you in the next few minutes
is in the end, we actually do approximations
that the quantized electromagnetic field pretty
much disappears from the equation.
We have a classical field.
And then almost everything you have done in your homework
directly applies.
The only other thing we do today is the dipole moment.
Well, we use, for the dipole moment of the atom,
the solution of the optical Bloch equation.
So we get rid of all the quantum character
of the electromagnetic field in two stages.
One is the following-- well, we want
to describe the interactions of atoms with laser fields.
And that means the electromagnetic field
is in a coherent state.
And you know from several weeks ago,
the coherent state is a superposition
of Fock states, coherent superposition, and such.
So they are really photons inside.
It's a fully quantized description of the laser beam.
And this is something if you're not familiar,
you should really look up.
There is an exact canonical transformation
where you transform your Hamiltonian into, so to speak,
a basis transformation to another Hamiltonian.
And the result is, after this unitary transformation,
the coherent state is transformed to the vacuum
state.
So in other words, the quantized electromagnetic field
is no longer in a coherent state.
It's in a vacuum state.
But what appears instead is a purely
classical electromagnetic field, a C-number.
So you can sort of say--
I'm waving my hands now--
the coherent state is a vacuum with a displacement operator.
All the quantumness of the electromagnetic field
is in the vacuum state.
And that's something we have to keep because this
is responsible for spontaneous emission, quantum
fluctuations, and such.
But the displacement operator, which
gives us an arbitrary coherent state, that
can be absorbed by completely treating
the electromagnetic field classically.

So therefore, we take the fully quantized
electromagnetic field, and we replace it now
by a classical field and simply the vacuum fluctuation.
So there are no photons around anymore.
There is the vacuum ready to absorb the photons.
And then there is a classical electromagnetic field
which drives the atoms, and of course,
the classical electromagnetic field
is not changing because of absorption emission,
because it's a C-number in our Hamiltonian.
So this is an important conceptional step,
and it's a first step how we get rid of the quantum
nature of the electromagnetic field
when it interacts with atoms mechanically.
