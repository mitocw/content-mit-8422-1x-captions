Now we have the friction coefficient.
Let's take it further.
I want to give you-- in this perturbative limit,
I want to give you the momentum diffusion coefficient.
Then we will find in the perturbative limit,
what is the lowest temperature to which we can cool?
So pretty much I do everything as we have done before,
but I use the simple perturbative limit.
Again, in order to calculate the diffusion coefficient,
the momentum diffusion coefficient in the heating,
we need the fluctuations of the force.
Just remember, we're in the perturbative limit.
The atom is mainly in the ground state, which
is the upper dressed level.
It has only a little excited state at mixture,
so it will mainly stay in this state.
But then with this excited state,
it makes this power of the Rabi frequency.
It makes a transition to the other dressed state.
But the other dressed state is almost 100% excited state.
It will leave the other dressed state almost immediately.
This could be akin to Monte Carlo wave function result,
that the atom experiences the force
in the upper dressed level, then it goes to the lower dressed
level, which is mainly the excited state, just for a time
1 over gamma, and then it returns.
The picture now is that the atom, for almost all the time,
experiences the steady state force, which
is the blue dashed line.
Then only when it goes to the other dressed state,
there are small spikes where the force has changed sign.
If we now calculate the fluctuations of the force,
the integral of F squared.

Once we calculate the square, the small deviation
from the average force does not contribute.
What contributes are the spikes.
All I do is, I take the force square in one of the spikes.

And the force is nothing else in the derivate.
Remember, we have a standing wave of u0.
The derivative of the standing wave is the force.
But if you have a sinusoidal lattice,
the force is k times the amplitude of the lattice.
I square it.
So this is the spike squared, then I
have to multiply with a time 1 over gamma,
over which the force stays the same.
You can see the correlation time of the force.
But then I have to multiply-- also when I do an average over
many trajectories, I have to average over the probability
that--
I have to multiply with the probability
that the atom is in the dressed state one
and not in a stage two.
It may take you a few minutes just
to think about the combinatorics.
But in the end all I do is I take the force square
and multiply with the correlation time
when the atom is in stage two, and get the probability
that the atom is in stage two.
And when the atom is in stage one, in my ensemble,
it doesn't contribute at all, because in stage one
you're so close to the average force
that it doesn't contribute with the fluctuation.
Anyway, it's simple but subtle.
It's a one-liner.
And now based on this perturbative picture,
we have perturbatively exact, an expression for the heating
rate.
But now it's interesting.
The rate, gamma 1,2, the rate to switch between dressed energy
levels, all of this also appears in the expression
for the friction coefficient.
Therefore, if you are now asking,
what is the ultimate temperature to which we can cool the atom?
It is the ratio of this analytic result for the heating
coefficient divided by the analytical result
for the friction coefficient.
Pretty much everything cancels out, and what remains is u0.
This is a remarkable result. It's highly non-trivial,
and I really enjoy it, showing to you how simply it can be
derived by--
it's really just perturbation theory,
but you have to put in the right concepts from the dressed atom
picture.
What we learn is the following.
If we have a standing wave, and we
cool with a stimulated force, the lowest temperature
is with a prefect of which I haven't calculated,
the amplitude of the standing wave.
That means that it is impossible to ever localize atoms
within a standing wave.
Laser cooling cannot be used to create atoms in an optical
lattice.
The temperature of the atoms is always
comparable to the depths of the lattice,
so therefore the atoms will never
be localized in one well of the lattice.

This is generally valued.
The assumption we have made here is
that we have a two level atom.
Well, a lot of you have worked with atoms in optical lattices,
and you often use evaporative cooling,
take a Bose-Einstein condensate, which is pretty much nanokelvin
temperature, put it in an optical lattice.
But before '95, people studied laser cooling in atoms
in optical latices.
And this was only possible because atoms
can be cooled to lower temperatures
than we have derived here, because they are not two level
atoms.
Laser cooling in a standing wave, localization
of atoms in a standing wave by laser cooling
is only possible by physics beyond what we have discussed.
Collin?
If you use something like Raman sideband cooling,
you could get a three levels for that,
but you eliminate the third.
Really, is just that it's too low.
If you do Raman sideband cooling.
Keep posted, I think in the next 10 minutes
I cover what you want to see, because now it
involves two ground states.
I want to show you if you have two ground
states, two hyperfine--
Raman sideband cooling, if you have two different ground
states, there is new physics and I briefly
want to touch upon that.
Let me just fill in one thing here.
And that is, if you take everything
I've told you seriously, you would say, "OK.
Too bad.
We cannot localize atoms in an optical lattice
because the temperature is always comparable
to the amplitude of the lattice.
But by making the lattice smaller
and smaller and smaller, I can reach
lower and lower temperatures."
Well, yes, to some extent that's possible.
But what we've done here is we've done approximations.
We've only focused on the stimulated force.
We have not looked at the recoil which
comes in spontaneous emission.
And therefore, the moment we would make the optical lattice
smaller than gamma, then we have to include heating
by the spontaneous light force, and the result will be that
blue molasses cannot reach lower temperatures than red detuned
molasses.
And for red detuned molasses, we have already
discussed the famous Doppler limit
which just gamma over two.
So that's what I wanted to present to you
with the stimulated force.
First, a more general discussion using the real
dressed atom picture.
But now in the end to fly over using sort of the baby
dressed atom picture, which is simply perturbation theory.
