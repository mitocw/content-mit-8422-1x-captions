We want to understand the time evolution of the system.
Or tool is a time evolution operator.
And at the end of the class on Monday,
I told you, well, let's simplify things.
Let's get rid of those [INAUDIBLE]
integrations and multiple integrals
by simply doing a Fourier transform because a Fourier
transform turns an integral of a convolution into a product.
And so therefore, we introduced the Fourier transform
or Laplace transform of the time evolution operator.
And this iterative equation where we get the n's order
by plugging the n minus first order
on the right-hand side, this iterative equation
turns now into a simpler algebraic iterative equation
for the Fourier transform.
So this is now the starting point for our discussion today.
We are going to calculate the Fourier transform of the time
evolution operator to infinite orders.
So OK, we want to take this equation.
And now, we want to iterate it.
So the resolvent G in zeroes order is G0.
Now, plug G0 into the right-hand side of the equation.
And you get the first order, which is G0 V G0.
Now, plug that into the end of the iterative equation,
and you get the second order--
G0 V G0 V G0.
I think you've got the idea.
It's almost like a geometric series--
well, a geometric series with operators.
But this is already sort of a hint.
Geometric series can be summed up to infinity rather easily.
So we have to introduce now the eigenfunctions
of the unperturbed operator.
So these are let's say the ground state, excited state,
next excited state of your favorite atom.
And they have eigenenergies Ek.
If you're now expressing the equation above in the basis
kl--
so in other words, this is an operator,
and we want to know the matrix element
between eigenfunctions k and l--
the other thing we need is that G0.
Remember the Fourier transform--
and I gave you sort of a mini derivation here--
is just 1 over energy minus H.
And if you apply that now to the operator G0,
so G0 is nothing like--
it's given by that.
So therefore, if write now this equation as matrix elements,
the first part, the G0, gives us 1 minus 1 over z minus Ek.
Key And since we are diagonal in H0, it's delta kl.
And well now, you see the structure
if you sum over intermediate states
or if introduce immediate states.
So this is how we have to write it.
So this is just writing it down in basis function
of the unperturbed operator H0.
But now, we can formulate the problem we are encountering
and we want to solve.
Namely, we have the problem with one state.
Our problem is the excited state b.
And we have a resonant excitation
from the atom from the current state [INAUDIBLE].
So this is a discrete eigenstate of the unperturbed Hamiltonian
with energy Eb.
And therefore, we have terms, and actually divergent terms,
which are 1 over z minus Eb.
And just to make the connection, I mean this
is sort of the description in the book.
z is in the complex plane and you can have imaginary values.
You know sometimes, scattering and evolution equations
are better formulated when you do it in the complex plane.
It doesn't really matter for us here.
Just remember z is the energy.
And it is the initial energy.
And the initial energy is, if it's
a ground state and a resonant photon,
we have a problem because the denominator is zero.
So in other words, for resonant excitation,
we are interested in the case that z is
