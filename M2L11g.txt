The derivation is focusing on two chapters in API.
I need one result, which I hope you remember.
We formulated the time evolution of the system using the time
propagation operator U, and we found an exact expression,
and dropping all the arguments here,
T and T prime, and you can look them up either in the book
or in the previous lecture notes,
we found that the propagator in the interaction representation
is the unperturbed operator, U nought.
And then, now I need actually the terms,
it was a time integral over some time T 1,
which involved U nought, V, and U.
And I introduced that to you as you could plug that
into whatever is the equivalent of Schrodinger's
equation for the time evolution operator,
and you really find this is the solution for U,
but well, it's not really a solution,
because it's a solution of U expressed in terms of U.
But then I showed you that it allows an iterative approach,
and this is why we did it.
If you have a first order result,
the zero order result is U nought.
When you plug the zero order result in here,
you get the first order correction.
When you put the first order result here,
you get the second order correction,
so you get a recursive formula, which solves the problem.
And this is now our starting point.
This is an exact formulation of QED,
and this is now our starting point
to address the problem of divergencies.
We want to describe what many of you do in the lab,
namely have resonant laser light interact with atoms.
And I want to show you how can you
describe it with QED, with the formulation we've introduced.

For this chapter, we want to have one big simplification.
Things aren't only getting complicated,
they're getting simpler.
If you have a time integral, which is a convolution,
and you can often simplify it by Fourier transforming it,
because the Fourier transform of a convolution
is simply the product of the two Fourier transforms.
There is one glitch, so the one subtlety I want to feed in,
in a moment, but let's just assume
for a moment we go from time, we Fourier transform
to frequency or energy.
So G of E is the Fourier transform m
I have to fill in a few corrections of U.
That would mean, if that were true,
that the equation above would now
be an equation where the integral is sort of constant.
Instead of the convolution of U nought and U,
we get simply the product of the two Fourier transforms.
That's much, much simpler.
It's an algebraic equation instead
of an integral equation.
And remember when we got n's order,
we n integrals with some time ordering.
We were able to do it, but it's mathematically
more complicated.
The problem is that this is not a convolution.
It would be a convolution if the time limits were infinite.
So what we can do instead is we can define G of E,
not the Fourier transform of U. If we
say it is the Fourier transform of K, which uses a step
function, then if you insert now K in the formula above,
you see that because of the step function
we can now take the integral limits for minus infinity
to plus infinity.
So therefore, when I set G, G is called the resolvent.
It's really the mathematical quantity
we have to work on now.
And I wanted to tell you very simply.
Hey it's just the Fourier transform of the time evolution
operator.
Not quite, it's the Fourier transform of the time evolution
operator with a theta function, just to make sure
that formally we can extend the upper and lower integration
limits to infinity.
Or this is also a name, what I'm really
kind of discussing here are Laplace transformations.
But I want to convey to you the physics.
It would take many weeks to do the mathematics accurately,
but you can get the idea, and a really profound feeling
for how QED works and what we are doing, with not so
much mathematical rigor.
So with that grain of salt, we have Fourier transformed
the equation, we have the Fourier transform
of the time evolution operator.
But if you look at it mathematically more exact
it's a Laplace transform, and we are a little bit
navigating in a complex place.
The Fourier transform does not exist for real values,
we always have to add a small imaginary part
to make things converge, but we've
seen that in many other places ISO.
OK, so the quantity which allows us
to describe resonant interaction in a very straightforward way
is called the resolvent.
I can simply define the resolvent.
All I gave you was somewhat evasion, but if I had wanted,
I could just say the resolvent is defined
by this operator equation.
Z is the complex number.
H is the Hamiltonian, including interaction between atoms
in the electromagnetic field.
And if you take this and plug it into the equation above,
you find this expression solves the equation.
So I just want to say, you can forget about all the subtleties
with the Laplace transform and such,
you can just say that we define some interesting object,
but it is connected to what I said earlier because this
solves this equation.
And also I'd like to show you the mathematical structure.
If you write the time evolution operator,
it's e to the minus, the Hamiltonian,
and now you Fourier transform.
If you Fourier transform it, you multiply it
with e to the i omega t, and you integrate.
Let me integrate from zero to infinity.
There are some issues with zero or infinity,
but if you simply solve this integral with time,
you have sort of an exponent e to i, omega minus H.
So if you Fourier transform it, what you obtain
is nothing else than the energy minus H.
And this looks very, very similar
to the definition of the resolvent.
The only mathematical thing I'm not fully discussing here
is, is z real, or has it a small imaginary part?
The small imaginary part actually,
you have to add a small imaginary part here
to make sure the Fourier transform exists.
But you should clearly see how things are connected.
So OK, I'm focusing now on the resolvent.
It is equivalent to the time evolution operator.
It is a sort of Fourier transform of it.
And we want to formally write down a diagrammatic solution
for the resolvent.
