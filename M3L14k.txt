Once we know what the optical Bloch
vector is doing spectrally, we know the spectrum
of the emitted light.
And for that, for the optical Bloch vector,
we simply look at this matrix.
And we ask what are the eigenvalues of this matrix.
This 3 by 3 matrix has three eigenvalues.
The real part of those eigenvalues
gives us the position of the model triplet.
And the imaginary part gives us the width of those peaks.
So if you look at this matrix--
and I'm not doing the complicated cases here--
if you look at this matrix for delta equals 0 and g equals 0,
well, it is already in diagonal form.
So it has three imaginary eigenvalues
minus gamma over 2 minus gamma 2 minus gamma.
So this matrix has three complex eigenvalues.
And I want to discuss two cases.
For this case, we have minus gamma over 2
for the x and y component of the optical Bloch vector.
And the z component is minus gamma.
And this is the situation--

apart from a factor of 2--
that we have gamma, 2 gamma and gamma.

The factor of 2 comes, of course,
are you asking what is the spectrum of the electric field
or what is the spectrum of the power?
If you go from e to e squared, then
if you have an exponential decay with gamma of e,
e squared decays with 2 gamma.
So that's where factors of 2 come from.
[INAUDIBLE]?

Yes.

Give me a second.
[INAUDIBLE] g equals 0, right?
The factors here, we are looking at limiting cases.
And the more important thing is that this
is the case of weak drive.
So what is more important is that the drive frequency is 0.
I'm not giving you the full picture here.
Yes.
The full glorious derivation is in API.
And I just try to sort of entertain you
by giving you a few appetizers.
If you want, read it up there.
But what I want to show you is there are two simple cases.
But it looks already intriguing, because here, this
is wider than the side bands and here it's the opposite.
And I want to give you a taste of it.
And I'm not doing it rigorously.
And you're right, I have to think about it.
But the important part is that the drive frequency is 0.
We are not driving.
We're not rotating in x.
The system is mainly rotating around the z-axis.
And at that moment, the matrix for the differential equation,
for the optical Bloch vector, has three imaginary parts.
It's gamma, 2 gamma, and gamma, or half of it
if you look at the amplitude.
And now I want to just show you in a second how
we can get the second part.
But yeah, I'm guilty as charged.
There are small gaps in my argument.
But all I want to show you is how you find--
I want to just sort of convince you
that the optical Bloch equations with this matrix
have all the ingredients to explain it.

So what I've done here is, I've shown you that we
have those three ingredients.
And actually, the moment--
sorry, I should have said it before, answering
your question-- when we now crank up
delta, what we're physically doing
is we are doing a rapid rotation of the Bloch vector
around the z-axis.
So when we're rapidly around the z-axis,
we are not doing anything to the z component,
but we are strongly mixing the x and y component.
But since we have the imaginary part--
I'm waving my hands now-- we're not changing the imaginary part
for x and y.
And we still have two imaginary parts
which are gamma over 2, 1 imaginary part which is gamma.
So if you do a rapid rotation around the z-axis,
we obtain three eigenvalues.
I first showed you what are the eigenvalues
of this matrix in one case, which is just a warm-up.
I'm telling you there are those three values.
And now I'm saying, we are interested
in the physical situation of rapid rotation.
The rapid rotation modifies the three eigenvalues.
The three eigenvalues are no longer real.
The rapid rotation around the z-axis
adds an imaginary i delta to the x and y-axis.
Because now we are rotating, x and y are getting mixed.
And this means now that we have three peaks.
They are located here in the rotating frame at 0.
This is the carrier at plus/minus delta.
These are the two sidebands.
And these parts are the width of it.
This is how you have to interpret the result.
So we have now three peaks and the full width
of half maximum for the intensity, which
is the amplitude squared is gamma, 2 gamma, and gamma.
And we can now immediately proceed to the next case.
If we are on resonance, and we drive the system strongly,
now we are driving the system strongly around,
not the z-axis, around the x-axis.
So now if we add the strong drive around the x-axis,
we have now eigenvalues which is plus/minus i g.
This is the rotation we add.
And this gives e to the i, if in rotation, with g, e
to the i omega t gives an i g.
And what happens is the following--
the rapid rotation around the x-axis--

well, if you rotate around the x-axis, you're not touching x.
And without any rotation, we had an eigenvalue
for x which was minus gamma over 2.
And if you take the matrix of whatever the system
and rotate it around the x-axis, this
is preserved, but the rotation around, say,
x strongly mixes y and z.
So therefore, the two other eigenvalues
appear at rotation i g.
And it is now the average of gamma and gamma over 2,
which is 3/4 gamma.
And if we go to the amplitude squares, it is 3/2.
So therefore, we have the situation
that we have those three eigenvalues.
And this is responsible for the three peaks at plus/minus g
and 0.
And the width of it is--
I have to multiply by a factor of 2 gamma and 3/2 gamma.
And this explains the two limiting cases
