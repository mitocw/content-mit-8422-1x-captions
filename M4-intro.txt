Welcome to module 4 of the course in Atomic and Optical
Physics.
In module 4, we take the topic to the next level.
We are considering a new property of light, namely
mechanical properties.
Light cannot only transfer energy, and excite atoms,
and transfer population between internal states.
Light can also change the momentum of atoms,
and these are called optical forces, or light forces.
In this module, we provide the first principal presentation
of those forces, and then we discuss it
in the context of laser cooling.
We discuss optical molasses, we discuss a magneto-optic trap.
So we are providing an introduction
into all the tools which have revolutionized
atomic physics in the '80s.
We will also emphasize the dressed-atom picture,
which provides a very powerful and intuitive way
to describe light forces.
Finally, we go beyond light forces
by discussing magnetic fields, which
can exert forces on atoms, and these are magnetic traps.
Magnetic traps, together with evaporative cooling,
enabled Bose-Einstein condensation,
another major revolution in atomic physics
which occurred in the '90s.
