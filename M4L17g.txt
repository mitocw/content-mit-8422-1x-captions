Let me just summarize.
The traced atom picture has given us
two pieces of major insight into the stimulated force.
The first one is that the atom experiences always
opposite forces in the two traced levels.
And it is a population imbalance between the two traced levels
which results in a net force.
And this requires either red deturning, then the force
is repulsive, or blue detuning--
sorry, red detuning, and then the force is attractive,
or blue detuning, then is the force repulsive.
Second, with this time lag thing,
we understand that time lag, [INAUDIBLE],
is the way to get cooling.
And the third things we have learned, when the atom does
the radiative cascade, the force, when
it goes from the upper to the lower trace level, the force
is suddenly reversing its sign.
And this causes fluctuations that shakes up the atom.
And this causes heating.
And this has nothing to do with the other heating mechanism we
discussed earlier, namely, every time there
is spontaneous emission, there's a random recoil.

In strong laser fields, the fluctuations
of the stimulated force, which has
nothing to do with spontaneous emission,
are much, much larger than the photon recoil.
So therefore, for strong laser fields,
it is this alternation of the force when
atoms switch traced energy levels, which
is responsible for most of the heating.
I want to come now to another physical situation which
is actually wonderful.
You learned about Sisyphus cooling.
Everybody in cold atom speaks about Sisyphus cooling,
because it's a very, very elegant cooling scheme.
We usually apply, in the laboratory,
Sisyphus cooling when we do polarization gradient cooling.
I will tell you a few things later.
But this is much harder to understand than the Sisyphus
cooling, which takes place for a two-level atom
moving through a blue detuned a standing wave.
So in other words, I try to explain now to you
what Sisyphus cooling is.
The relevant application is multi-level polarization
gradient cooling, which I give you an idea,
but it's hard to fully describe.
But here, in our current discussion
on the two-level atom interacting
with one laser beam, or one standing wave,
we find the simplest physical realization
of Sisyphus cooling.
So just to make sure that you are following the argument,
I have so far explained to you why
blue detuned light cools in the limit of very small velocities.
Very small velocity means we did a first order Taylor
expansion in this lag time.
But now, I want to discuss with you a different regime, namely
that the atom moves with a velocity such
that it can go up and down several periods of the standing
wave before it does spontaneous emission.
So before, when we discussed the friction coefficient,
the velocity was infinitesimal.
But now, I assume that the velocity is such
that the atom can surf a few waves,
and then it will spontaneously emit.
And let me assume that we are blue detuned.
So the atom, let's say here, where the splitting is minimal,
well, this is where we don't have light.
The generalized Rabi frequency is just the tuning,
So we are in a node of the standing wave.
And then the atom starts in the ground state,
and it experiences the periodic potential
due to the standing wave.
But we are going to now ask, OK, when did spontaneous emission
happen in this picture?
Well, it cannot happen here, when the atom is in the ground
state, when there is no light.
But when there is light, when the atoms moves
to an anti-node, there is a mixture, indicated in red,
of the excited state.
So in other words, when an atom does this roller coaster,
it will most likely emit a photon, either the carrier,
or one of the sidebands, when it is
at the maximum of the potential corresponding
to an anti-node where it experiences the light.
OK.
When the atom emits on the carrier,
it goes from the upper traced level
to the upper traced level.
Then nothing has happened, because the atom
is in the same traced level.
Let me now discuss the case when something happens.
And this is when the atom decays from the upper traced level
to the lower traced level.
And at least for weak excitation,
the lower traced level corresponds
to the excited state.
In other words, when there is no light,
the upper traced level was ground state,
the lower traced level is excited state.
But what happens now is actually interesting.
The atom had to climb up the hill,
but the spontaneous emission to the lower traced level
takes the atom to the bottom.
So you can say, on average it has climbed a hill here,
but now it is at the bottom.
And now we want to ask, how does the atom get out
of the lower traced level?
Well, the lower traced level is mainly excited when the--
it's 100% excited, if there is no light.
But if there is light--
and light means the generalized Rabi frequency is larger--
the excited state has now an admixture
of the ground state, because the light mixes
ground and excited state.
So now, of course, whenever there is red,
you can spontaneously emit.
But there is a probability that the atom
is more likely to emit when you are in a pure excited state,
and not in a mixed state.
So now, talking about the lower manifold,
the atom does its roller coaster.
It has a velocity that it can cover
several periods of the standing wave in one lifetime,
but there is a higher probability for the atom
now to emit when it is on top of the hill.
So that's remarkable.
We have the upper traced level, we have the lower traced level.
The atom is doing the roller coaster.
But whenever it emits a side band, whenever
it switches state, it mainly does it
by emitting at the top of the hill.
And after the spontaneous emission,
it finds itself at the bottom of the hill.
So on average, the atom is climbing more uphills
than downhills.
And this is called Sisyphus cooling.
I think you've all heard about the Greek myth of King
Sisyphus, who was condemned.
He challenged the gods, and he got his punishment.
And his punishment was that he always has
to roll a stone up the hill.
And when he's done, the stone falls down,
and he has to roll the stone up.
So in other words, we have condemned the atoms
to the same verdict.
They always have to go uphill to work.
Then they fall downhill with the help of a spontaneous photon.
But then, they have to climb uphill.
And it is the uphill climb where they experience a net friction
force which cools the atoms down and reduces
their kinetic energy.

So this is Sisyphus cooling.
And since I need it in a few minutes,
I just wrote down for you, based on this simple and wonderfully
elegant picture, how much energy does
the atom lose per unit time.
What is the cooling rate?
Well, it's clear that the cooling rate
comes when the atom switches from one
traced energy level to the next, because nothing
happens on the carrier.
So it is the transition rate between traced level one
and trace level two.
And then we multiply with u0 the debts
of the optic lattice, because it is this energy difference which
is extracted from the atom.

You may ask, OK, what is time limiting?
It's really the transition rate from the first traced level,
which is mainly the ground state,
to the other traced level, which is mainly exciting state.
Because once the atom is in this level, which is mainly
the excited state, it will pretty much
do the next transition at a rate which
corresponds to the spontaneous emission rate.
So in other words, if you're not fully on resonance,
or if you're not saturated in laser power,
the rate 1:2 is slower than the rate 2:1.
And therefore, this radius is the rate limiting step.

Let me show you just a few pictures.
What I'm just explaining to you was explored very early on.
Just have to sort of put you back,
that it was in the mid-80s, '82, '83, '84, that people developed
[? Zaman ?] slowing.
It was in '85 that optical molasses with red detuned light
was demonstrated for the first time.
It was in '86 that the dipole trap was demonstrated
by Steve Chu, and in '87 that Steve Chu and Dave
Pritchard introduced the magneto optic trap.
So the mid to late '80s were fantastic times
where one important technique was realized and demonstrated.
And this was actually the first major experimental paper
of a new laser cooling group, which
was founded by [INAUDIBLE], at the L'ecole Normale Superior
in Paris.
And it was exactly about cooling atoms with stimulated emission.
And this is blue molasses. [? This. ?]
And you exactly see here, out of this paper, the Sisyphus
cooling mechanism.

And addressing the question about red detuned light here,
this was actually beam experiment.
You had a blue detuned standing wave,
and you were sending an atomic beam through.
And if this atomic beam was cooled,
the divergence of the atomic beam was reduced.
So this experiment had only one blue detuned standing
wave, and nothing else, because it was not
a trapping experiment, it was a beam collimation experiment.
And what is shown here is that you
have the original atomic beam profile.
And for blue detuned light, you make it narrower.
So this is cooling.
Whereas, for red detuned light, you were defocusing,
