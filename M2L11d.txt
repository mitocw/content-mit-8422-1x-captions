It's mainly classical E and M. We sum up
over all modes with a boundary condition,
with a metallic boundary condition.
If you have in general a dielectric or semiconductor
which is not an ideal metal-- has
different boundary conditions-- the Casimir force will change.
And this is actually pretty outstanding, difficult problem
where people have really chewed on hard.
I think Lipschitz has some famous solution on it.
What is the Casimir force for an arbitrary dielectric constant
of the surface material?
But absolutely yes.
If you don't have a metallic boundary condition,
your Casimir force changes.

I think this is sort of an interesting point.
And it may trigger immediately discussions.
What does it really mean?
But let me go now through the derivation where we have
metallic boundary condition.
And this actually leads to a quantitative derivation
of the Casimir force, quantitative in the way
that we get--
we are not just getting the power law.
We get the prefactor.
We get everything 100% out of this derivation.

So what is the mechanism for the Casimir force changing,
because if I think of it in the picture,
like two metal plates at the lower density [INAUDIBLE]
outside, even with the arbitrary boundary condition, [INAUDIBLE]
the same density of modes.
So what is the physical mechanism
for changing the [INAUDIBLE]
To the best of my knowledge, it is the density of modes.
But it's very subtle.
I suggest, since not everybody is probably
familiar with the way how I will count
all the modes in the metal plate, let me just do that.
And I hope then it's obvious or we should then
discuss the boundary conditions being modified.
So the idea is the following.
If the Casimir force is only due to zero-point fluctuations
of the electromagnetic field, let me say upfront,
this is a valid assumption.
I get a valid result. But I will tell you in half an hour
that you can take another perspective
and say this is just a holistic description.
There are other derivations of the Casimir force
which do not use the concept of zero-point energy at all.
So in other words, I'm presenting
you one presentation of the problem,
one solution of the problem.
But there's a whole different formulation.
But here, I assume--
I can easily [INAUDIBLE]
Well, here we have two metal plates.
We want to understand if there is
potential energy and attraction between the two metal plates.
And let's just calculate what is the total energy of the system.
And if I have two metal plates which
are two mathematical boundary conditions,
all I have to calculate is the ground state
of the electromagnetic field in between.
And that means I have to find all the modes.
And each mode contribute h bar omega over 2.
So this is our agenda now.
We say the metal plates are not real objects.
They are mathematical boundary conditions--
looks like a good assumption.
And now based on those boundary conditions,
we calculate the zero-point energy of the world, at least
of the electromagnetic world.
And then we ask if the plates are a little bit closer,
has the total zero-point energy changed?
And when it has changed, that means
there is a force between the atoms
because the potential changes as a function of distance.
So this is the agenda I wanted to execute now.
As you know, when you write down modes in E and M
and you want to do it exactly, there are many, many indices.
But this is a result which could actually
come straight out of Jackson.
For your convenience, this is also discussed--
a wonderful discussion-- by [INAUDIBLE]
in [INAUDIBLE] from the '70s or '80s.
I've posted those on the web.
So if there is a mathematical detail you want to look up,
this is posted on the web.
So anyway, we have two metal plates with a distance L.
And we have metallic boundary conditions.
That means that when we calculate the modes,
we get TE modes and TM modes.
TE modes means there is no longer [INAUDIBLE]
electric field.
TM modes mean there is no longer [INAUDIBLE] magnetic field.
And the frequency of each modes is discrete.
In the z-direction, we have standing waves,
which are labeled with an integer value of M,
whereas parallel to the plate, the modes
can have an arbitrary transverse wave vector k.
And when we look at the dispersion relation,
the frequency of those modes is in quadrature.
You can say the component k square z
square of the transverse propagation
plus the component of the standing wave.

So for each M, for each integer value, we have a TE
and a TM mode with the exception of M equals 0.
For M equals 0, we don't have a TE mode.
We only have a TM mode.
So that's just fresh out of Jackson.
But it's very important now, and I want to spend a little bit
more time of it-- also, it's just a purely classical
result--
what is the density of states?
Well, let's assume we have a given M.
So we have a standing wave perpendicular
to the capacitor plates.
And therefore, now the density of modes only
comes from the transverse k.
So it is from this k square.
And you know that the number of modes
is proportional to the volume in k-space.
And the important part is that I can write this as dk square.
But k square is E omega square.
And this gives me omega d omega.
So for each M-value, for each discrete mode perpendicular
to the plates, we have now a density
of modes which goes as omega d omega.
Before I show you the mathematical expression,
let me just plot that, what that means.
The number of modes was omega d omega.
That means the density of modes was proportional with omega.
That means for M equals 0, we started omega equals 0.
And we get a straight line.
For M equals 1 or M equals 1, shown in green,
and M equals 2, shown in purple, omega square
is the quadrature sum of k square and M square.
So therefore, if you want to ask what is the density of modes
for M equals 1 or M equals 2, you
have to start at the lowest frequency for M equals 1,
at the lowest frequency for M equals 2.
But then, as we just derived, the density of modes
is proportional to omega.
So what we want to do in the end--
we want to sum those modes all up.
And what we will observe is that here, we have
sort of a line with slope 1.
Here we have to sum two lines with slope 1.
Here we have to sum three lines with slope 1.
So progressively, the slope gets higher and higher.
But a slope which increases linearly with the coordinate
axis--
if it were continuously, would just be a parabola.
So in other words, if I would [INAUDIBLE]
the density of states, which comes from the exact mode
spectrum, if I would [INAUDIBLE] it would be parabola.
And a parabolic density of state--
the number of modes is omega square d omega.
This is three-dimensional space.
So in other words, what we observe is what exactly
the effect of the boundary condition is.
Instead of getting this smooth parabola omega squared,
we have sort of broken up the parabola
into piecewise linear pieces.

And the fact that we have a boundary condition,
that we have plates in free space and not just free space,
is actually the difference between the two.
So it is the difference between the two which leads to the fact
that a boundary condition modifies the vacuum energy.
With that, the rest is mathematics.
But I want to show you the steps because it
is ingenious mathematics.
It makes a few approximations it creates a few infinities
and gets rid of it.
It's actually rather wild but amazing that in the end,
we have a simple exact result.
So the most important thing is we have a density of states.

And the density of states for one M is proportional to omega.
But now we have to multiply.
When we want to know what is the density of state at a given
omega, we have to multiply with the integer
number of discrete modes which are available at this omega.
So this is because there is only one M equals 0 node.
We have a 1 here.
And then for M equals 1 entire, we have a [INAUDIBLE]
between TE and TM.
So this is just counting the modes.

And this is now a mathematical trick--
that instead of counting the modes--
it's an integer-- we can sum up Heaviside step functions
and sum over all M. This is just an exact rewrite.
But this is something which helps us to--
in the next step to do an integral.
So far, we haven't made any approximation.
We have just reminded ourselves what
is the exact result of classical E and M.
But now we want to calculate the zero-point energy.
So now it's getting interesting because we
take the classical result and take it into quantum physics.
The first step is very innocent.
We say each mode contributes h bar omega over 2.
And then we integrate with the density of states.
And the next line is also an exact result,
just using the density of modes from the previous page.
But of course, now we are asking for trouble.
We are integrating with omega squared d omega.
And there is a UV catastrophe.
Well, now I can say--
I can put on my mathematical hat and say
let's add a convergent term, something which exponentially
decreases with omega, which is just cutting off
the high-frequency part.
And I hope that in the end--
and this will come out, too--
that I get a result which is independent of the cutoff.
So by choosing this cutoff parameter lambda to 0,
I have-- if this is 0, I have no cutoff.
So maybe I can introduce a cutoff and then at the end
let lambda go to 0.
And if this gives me a physical result,
I've sort of mathematically tricked around.
But I also like the physical justification for that.
You know that a metal plate has not metallic boundary
conditions at infinitely high frequency.
If you go deep to the X-rays and gamma rays,
it becomes transparent.
So therefore, we would argue that once we go to very, very
high frequencies, the modes do not
feel that there is a boundary condition.
And therefore, we may be allowed to do some physical cutoff.

So we do this cutoff by--
so now we have to find the zero-point energy.
The zero-point energy has a sum over M.
And I call each integral I sub M.
And this integral is the omega square
from the density of states, but now multiplied
with the convergence term, whether it's
mathematical or physical.
And by introducing this cutoff, I
can now exactly solve the integral.
The omega squared can be taken out of the interval
by taking the second derivative.
And this is just an exponential function
which can be integrated.
And therefore, we have a mathematical exact result.
So we are now able to do the integral
because we have avoided the divergence.

Now we come back and say we are really
interested if the cutoff is pushed
to higher and higher frequency.
And this means lambda equals 0.
So therefore, we want to take this expression
and expand it around lambda equals 0.

Well, you could say that's physically very well-motivated.
But if I take this function, which
is lambda, E to the lambda, or x times E to the x,
and expand it, I get divergencies 1 over x square.
So you would say, well, how can you expand it?
Well, let's see what happens.
Let's just do it.
Let's say we are interested around lambda or x equals 0.
We have some divergencies now.
But we have to find a way to deal with that.
So we get rid of some of the divergencies
in the following way by saying, well,
if you simply calculate the zero-point energy
between those two capacitor plates
and then if the plates come closer
and there is less zero-point energy,
we would say the plates attract each other.
But what happens is the plates are not moving.
And there is no world behind them.
The world is sort of as it is.
And that means we have to now look more carefully
at the zero-point energy of our capacity plates
where L is small and the rest of the world.
So we are now representing the word
as a big capacitor of size L0.
And then our plate is just moving within that
because we are not assuming that when the two capacitor
plates attract each other and move towards each other
that the size of the universe is changing.
So we want to move a boundary condition within the universe.
So therefore, the correct expression
for the zero-point energy is not the zero-point energy
[INAUDIBLE] capacity L. It's the zero-point energy
of a capacity of size L plus of a capacitor L0 minus L.
And so we take the result and simply
add the expressions for L and L0 minus L. And what is now nice
is that the first highly divergent term with 1
over lambda to the 4--
[INAUDIBLE] that we want to let lambda go to 0--
it becomes independent of L.
So we would say, well, if there is an infinity,
it doesn't change with L. It doesn't provide a potential.
It's just one of those infinities which is constant,
which is not affecting the physics.
Also, here, this is independent of L.
And then the next term gives us the famous Casimir potential 1
over L cube.
And it is independent of lambda.
So we have a result which was independent of the cutoff we
introduced earlier.

So therefore, we have derived--
[INAUDIBLE] was a little bit of hand-waving
to navigate around infinities-- that the potential between two
metal plates is 1 over L cube.
A square was the area, the size of the capacitor plates.
And this is the exactly prefactor.
Or if you want to figure out what
is the pressure of the vacuum, pressure is, of course,
force per unit area.
So you take the derivative of the potential that the force.
That's the force per unit area.
And this is now the vacuum pressure.

Sort of funny-- now you can put it in a unit.
It's 10 to the minus 5 millibar at a distance of 1 micrometer.

So anyway, this is, I think, the classic derivation
of the Casimir potential by, I would say,
exactly summing up the zero-point energy
within a certain boundary condition.
Maybe to address Colin's question,
what would happen if the metal plates were maybe
semiconductors or had a different dielectric constant?
The mode spectrum would change.
How do you have mixed boundary conditions?
You don't have these nicely spaced--
I don't know how to calculate.
That's a hard problem.
And a lot of people have really worked very hard on it.
It seems for idealized boundary condition,
you can do it easily.
But it has been truly a challenge
to mathematical physics.
And I'm not even sure if it has been solved in all generality
or only in special examples to extend that
to arbitrary surfaces.
But we can, for instance, assume if you have a conductor which
is not conductive, which has not infinite conductance,
0 resistivity, then the electric field
can penetrate a little bit into the conductor.
And if the electric field penetrates into it,
it changes the frequency of the mode.
