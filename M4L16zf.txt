OK, we have done molasses in one dimension.
We have done beam slowing.
We just did a short discussion about molasses
in [INAUDIBLE] dimensions.
The one technique which is missing now
is the magneto-optic trap.
Let me just spend five minutes to discuss the background
behind the magneto-optic trap, because for many of you,
I think you were just born when the magneto-optic trap was
invented.
Well, I joined the field in 1990.
I joined the field in 1990, and that was three years
after the magneto-optic trap has been invented.
And one could actually say, many people say, it was,
if that is one more singular development in laser
cooling and such, it's molasses and the magneto-optical trap.
So let me tell you why the magneto-optical trap, you
shouldn't take it for granted.
It was actually in 1983 that Ashkin--
was it Gordon or Ashkin?
I think Ashkin, Art Ashkin-- that he presented
an optical Earnshaw theorem, And it is nicely
described in Bill Phillips' Varenna notes, which
I have posted on the website.
And it's pretty much proof that you cannot build a trap using
the spontaneous light force.
So in other words, this is a proof
which people took as a correct proof
that something like the magneto-optic trap
will not exist.
So what is this proof like?
Well, and that teaches you what was the mental concept,
or the mental barrier, people had
to break through before they invented
the magneto-optic trap.
The proof is the following.
If you think that you have beams.
I mean, a model for the spontaneous life force
is you have photons, and the photons
are sent blasting the atom.
Each photon is like a grain of sand,
and the atom is then scattering the sand in all directions.
You can really make this completely classical picture
of the spontaneous light force.

Almost.

If you do that, you would say the spontaneous light force
is proportional to the stream of photons, which is described
by the Poynting vector.
But now, you have in electromagnetism, a continuity
equation, which says the divergence of the Poynting
vector plus the change of energy density in a certain volume
has to be zero.
So if you are in a steady state, if you
have an arrangement of laser beams
and the intensity or the energy density
of the electromagnetic field is at steady state, that tells you
that the divergence of the Poynting vector has to be zero.
Well, if the divergence of the Poynting vector
is zero, using this equation, that
says the divergence of the spontaneous light force
has to be zero.
But if the divergence of the force has to be zero,
that means you cannot have a force which is inward from all
directions, because such a force,
a trap needs a force which is inward.
A trap requires a negative divergence.

Do you see the wrong assumption in this proof?
Or did I convince you that the magneto-optic trap is not
possible, because this proof would say you cannot make
a trip out of the spontaneous light force.

Well, you threw out the change in energy density, so that's--
But that's OK, because light, if you switch on a laser beam,
light travels at the speed of light.
And 10 to the minus 10 seconds, in picoseconds,
you reach steady state.
And you know when you operate the MOT,
you're not switching on and off your lasers at picoseconds.
It's not that.
Yes?
Do you use the spatial variation of c?
Yes, exactly.

The force is not just proportional to the Poynting
vector.
This would be true if I had grains of sand,
but photons have to fill a resonance condition.
You can assume, maybe assume, I'm an atom,
but I have a spatially varying magnetic field around me.
At one magnetic field, I feel the force of the laser beam
because I am resonant.
At another magnetic field, the laser beam just goes through me
because I'm not in resonance.
So therefore the proportionality between the Poynting vector
of the laser beam and the light force
ignores that the light force is resonant,
that the light force depends on polarization and such.
So the solution is the divergence of--
if the c parameter is spatially dependent,
then we can have a divergence, and then we can do trapping.
And it was actually Dave Pritchard, in '85 or in '86,
who wrote a really influential paper.
He said the optical Earnshaw theorem can be circumvented.
We can have a spatially dependent factor.
And what can be spatially dependent is saturation.
If you focus a laser beam, you have a spatially varying
saturation parameter.
There can be some optical pumping.
That can be light.
So he discussed several possibilities
how the optical Earnshaw theorem was circumvented.
At this point in 1986, he didn't realize
that it can be done with a magnetic field gradient.
When he talked about possible ways of circumventing
the optical Earnshaw theorem, [INAUDIBLE], who many of you
know, who is a famous researcher in our field,
had the idea that applying a magnetic field gradient
could work.
But nobody thought at this time that it
would work in three dimensions.
So the fact that it works in three dimension
is almost a miracle.
So when the idea was born, all those schemes, and also
the original idea of applying a magnetic field gradient,
were conceived as one-dimensional scheme.
Most of the schemes cannot be easily generalized to three
dimension, but the MOT scheme works as well in three
dimension as it works in one dimension.
Anyway, so this is sort of the background.
And since I was a post-doc when there were only two
or three groups who were operating a magneto-optic trap.
I put together with my own hands the first magneto-optic trap
which was ever used at MIT.
I mean, it's ancient history.
