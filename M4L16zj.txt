So we want to now exactly--
well, not-- we want to do the correct approximations
and after some approximations, exactly
solve what the atom does with one laser beam.
So the laser beam is described by the standard Hamiltonian
for single mode light.
The atom is described by, well, excitation energy omega 0
and b is the excited state.
So if you don't have any light-atom interaction,
the eigenstates are just product states, an atom in the excited
or the ground state.
And N is the photon number.
Colin.
You said that it's usually easier
to understand physics [INAUDIBLE]
versus [INAUDIBLE] equations.
Yes.
Can you think of--
is that sort of a general rule, or is this just
like it's only applicable to certain areas and [INAUDIBLE]
problems?

You're really asking an expert question.
And I talked to a Jean Dalibard and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji,
who invented the dressed atom picture when
I wanted to understand what happens when
we have a blue detuned lattice.
And I used the dressed atom picture, and I got confused.
So what happened is the following--
if you pick your right basis, the description is simple.
But simple means if all the physics is your atom
is in one dressed state or the other dressed state,
and it just transitions between the dressed states.
And that is easy, and this happens
in the limit of large detuning.
But if you are in the regime where
coherences between the dressed states matter--
in other words, the density matrix in the dressed state
basis has now off-diagonal matrix element,
the physics becomes complicated again.
So in other words, what I'm telling
you is, the best description happens when we have two level
system, we always need a 2 by 2 matrix,
but if you pick the description where the solution is diagonal.
If you have to deal with coherences,
and coherence is coupled to population, it's complicated.
And there are some cases--
one is the blue detuned lattice which
I encountered, where you have to consider the coherences to get
the correct answer.
And usually, also when the laser beams are weak
and on resonance, the dressed atom picture is not
providing any advantages.
So you want to use the bare picture for weak excitations
and yes, in the resonance case, the dressed atom picture,
if you're very close to resonance,
the dressed atom picture gets more complicated.
To give you the answer in something we've discussed,
you know already that when you drive
an atom with a laser beam, you get the Mollow triplet.
And the Mollow triplet shows you--
I hope we can finish that today--
shows you the energy splitting between the dressed energy
levels.
But if the Mollow triplet is not resolved
because the generalized Rabi frequency is small,
then you're not resolving your dressed atom levels.
And then the dressed atom level is not
providing a big advantage.
Yes, you have to pick.
For certain problems, the dressed atom picture
will not help you.
But I can reassure you, and this is
what I learned from Jean Dalibard and Claude
Cohen-Tannoudji, if you really look at the full matrix
with the off-diagonal matrix element and everything,
you will always find exactly the same solution.

OK, so anyway, we were just writing down
product states of the atoms and the eigenfunctions
of the Hamiltonian for the light,
which are Fock states, number of states with n and n plus 1.
But the important thing is now the following--
in the limit of small detuning, the ground state
with n plus 1 photon is almost degenerate with the excited
state with n photons.
And we call these two states a manifold, the manifold e of n.
And n is the photon number in the excited state.

So what happens is, if we look at all those states,
they are grouped into manifolds.
And the energy separation between two manifolds
is, of course, I go from n to n plus 1, the energy of a photon.
So now I introduce the atom-laser coupling
in the usual dipole approximation.
And what happens is this dipole approximation,
this dipole light-atom coupling, will couple, of course,
ground and excited state.
And it will, of course, have a big effect when
the energy splitting is small.
Well, you will see that in the next line.
But we have the co- and counter-rotating terms.
This dipole Hamiltonian will also
couple the ground state to the excited
state in the other manifold.
This is the off-resonant term, which we will neglect.
OK, so here are the equations for that.

Our electric field is, of course, a plus a dagger.
The dipole operator is that.
And if we take what is in front of the electric field,
and define this as the coupling constant g,
we have what I just told you--
that within a manifold, the ground state
with n plus 1 photons is coupled to the excited
state with n photons.
g is simply the coupling constant, which all parameters
have been included in that.
But then, because of the matrix element of a or a dagger,
we have the square root of n plus 1.

OK, so what we are now doing is we are going with this coupling
within a manifold, which is strong because the two
levels are energetically close.
And we will neglect the non-resonant couplings
to the other manifolds.
And that's just another way of doing, again, the rotating
wave approximation.
