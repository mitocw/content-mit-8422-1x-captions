Now, let's get some mileage out of it.
We will talk about light forces--
that's really interesting, and I hope it's another highlight
of this course--
to describe light forces in the dressed atom picture.
What I want to do here is already
in preparation for that.
I want to not yet introduce forces, simply
figure out what happens in the dressed atom picture
when the atoms scatter light.
And you know already the solution.
The solution is the Mollow triplet.
We have discussed, with your optical Bloch equations,
that at low laser power, the Mollow triplet
has three curves.
It has three broadened curves, and they
have different broadening.
I didn't prove it to you, but I mentioned to you
at low laser power there is--
perturbative laser power we discussed at great length
that there's a delta function.
And at low laser power, that delta function remains.
This is sort of the spectrum we get out of it.
What I want to show you now is how this spectrum is described
in the dressed atom picture.
Atom-Photon Interaction has a wonderful discussion
of all the details.
I will share with you a few highlights.
We will go much further in the description of the Mollow
triplet than we've gone before.
I will not go to all excruciating details.
Let's discuss first something we hadn't done so far.
What are the intensities in this Mollow triplet?

The way we obtain it is the following.
We have the manifold, the manifold with N minus one,
and the manifold within photons.
This is the detuning, and if you allow for the atom laser
coupling, the split in here is a generalized Rabi frequency.
You immediately see that in this picture, if you allow
spontaneous emission from the upper manifold to the lower
manifold, you have four different combinations.
One is the long photon, it's the blue sideband.
This is the red sideband.
This is blue sideband, this is a red sideband,
and those two are the carriers.
But now we can do the following.
I've just written it down for you
the solution of the wave function
with sine and cosine theta.

If we want to emit the blue sideband, we go from the top
to the bottom.
But that means since the photon in the rotating wave
approximation can only be emitted when we go from b to a,
we find that the matrix element for that
involves cosine theta times sine theta.
However, if you want to emit the carrier,
you go from here to there.
We always have to find the excited state to begin with.

I must have made a mistake.

Sorry.
When I want to emit the blue sideband, I go from all the way
up to all the way down, and I always
have to find an excited state which
connects to the ground state.
This gives me a term, which is cosine square.
The short, the red detuned sideband gives me sine square.
And if I want to get the carrier, this one,
I go from here to here.
