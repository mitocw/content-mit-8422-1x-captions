If you use the lowest second-order approach, then
diagrammatically, the process we have considered
is that we go to second order.
We can go through an intermediate state
by absorbing and emitting a virtual photon--
that's what two vertices mean.
At the first vertex, a photon appears.
At the second vertex, the photon disappears.
So that means now that we calculate
with this approximation, we approximate Gb
of c, the Fourier transform, the resolvents
in the following way.
We let b just propagate, which is problematic
because it has divergences.
But we are allowing now the state b
to go through intermediate states a.
And remember since this appears in the denominator, that
means for G, just make a Taylor expansion
in r that it has this process to all orders.
So the propagation G involves now all possibilities
that we have to end up in state b again.
But we can go through intermediate states
a or a prime as often as we want.
Or actually, we have summed it up.
Our result contains those processes to infinite order.
So the question is, what have we neglected?
I mean, that looks like a lot.
We allow the state b to emit a photon, go to another state.
It's reabsorbed and such.
So the question is now, what is neglected?
So what we neglect is actually a lot.
In this lowest order approximation
for the function r, we approximated r by second order.
We have only two vertices.
So what we neglect are all processes
where we have not just two vertices
in one intermediate states, where
we have several intermediate states between two
occurrences of the state b0.
Or diagrammatically, what we have neglected is--
I'll just give you an example--
so what we have neglected is we have
to always start with a state b.
And we have to end with a state b.
But now, the idea was that--
one, two, let me just go through four vertices--
the approximation we have done--
you have to sort of look through that maybe after the lecture
and see that that's what we've really done, but trust me--
the approximation we have done is that when
the system goes away from the state
b into an intermediate state a.
At the next vertex, it has to go back to the state b.
So what we have not included is processes
where we go through states a, a prime, a double prime,
and then eventually we go back to the state a.
Or we have not included processes where we scatter,
absorb--
this is a state a, but then we don't go back to b.
We go to a prime.
Then we scatter again.
Here we are in state a double prime.
And then we are back in b.
So in other words, we have said whenever something happens,
and we go away from state b, the next vertex
has to go back to state b.
This is the nature of the lowest state approximation.
We have included to infinite order
all processes where the state b emits a photon,
reabsorbs it, emits and reabsorbs it.
But it cannot-- the system cannot go sort of two steps
away from the state b.
It's only one step and then go back.
This is the nature of the approximation.
OK, so our result for this kernel, which describes
the state b, is we have--
just go back that you see it again.
I'm writing now for you down the equation for the triangle,
which is an interaction v, an intermediate state,
and another interaction v, which is nothing else than Fermi's
golden rule where we--
well, with a little twist-- but where
we have the initial state, the dipole interaction or the p
dot a interaction takes us to an intermediate state
with a photon with wavevector k and polarization epsilon.
We propagate in the intermediate state, Ea.
And now, we have to go back.
But we have to go back with the same matrix element.
So therefore, the matrix element is squared.
And we have a double sum.
We sum over all possible states of the photon.
And we can sum over all intermediate atomic states,
yes.
So this is what we have done.
This expression has, in general, a real part and imaginary part.
It's a function of the initial energy E.
And it has an imaginary part.

Let me know interpret it in two ways.
But before I do that, are there any questions?
Yes.
Just mathematically, how do you get an imaginary part out
of this?
It's all real components.
We have magnitude squared divided by--
presumably the energy is real, and so on.
OK this is now something to do that we have resonant terms.
And what we often do is we add an infinitesimal eta,
and then let eta go to 0.
And it's the same if you have the function 1 over x and look
at real part and the imaginary part,
it needs a little bit of correct treatment of functions
in the complex plane.

Let me actually write it down.
Then it becomes clear.
But yes, thanks for the question.
So I always said we do Fourier transform,
but it's a Laplace transform.
We do Fourier transform at real energy.
But if you do an integration along,
you do the Fourier transform, you
have to integrate over omega.
But the function we integrate, the time evolution operator,
has poles in omega.
So we can't just Fourier transform because we go right
through the poles.
But what we can do is we can add an imaginary part,
plus or minus eta, and we can just go around the poles.
And then it becomes mathematically meaningful.
And what we are doing here is-- but I'm not really explaining
it mathematically--
we have played those tricks here.
But I hope it becomes clear if I say
what the real and imaginary part are.
So the real part is this matrix element
squared, but double sum.
But what we use is the principal part of it,
which is well-defined in the theory of complex functions.
And for the-- it's divergent, but you
take a certain symmetric limiting procedure.
So you have to interpret that as--
you have to introduce a limiting procedure
to make sure that the divergence cancels out.
And the imaginary part value--
well, you have the imaginary part of something
which diverges.
And if you treat, if you treat the eta correctly,
let the eta go to 0, you will realize that the imaginary part
turns into a delta function.
So what we get is 2 pi over h bar matrix element squared
times the delta function.
So that's something which you have seen.
So the imaginary part gets us Fermi's golden rule.
And the real part has actually-- remember when we
discussed the AC Stark shift?
The AC Stark shift has a 1 over detuned independence.
And you recognize that here.
So this is actually nothing else than the AC Stark shift,
not due to a laser beam, but due to one photon per mode.
Because we started with an atom in an excited state,
it can emit a photon in any mode.
And this photon is now creating an AC Stark shift.
And this is mathematically the expression.
And such AC Stark shifts, which appear as self energies,
as energy shifts created by the state,
this is nothing else than the famous Lamb shift.
So that's what we get out here.
