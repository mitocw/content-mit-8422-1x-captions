And let's jump right into called cold fermions.
Almost everything I say in this talk
is summarized in a review paper, which
Professor Zwierlein and myself wrote a few years ago.
The paper will be posted to the group website
later this afternoon.
OK.
When we cool down fermions, lithium-6 and boson sodiums,
we immediately notice a difference.
The sodium cloud shrink, shrink, shrinks and forms
a small Bose-Einstein condensate,
whereas the lithium cloud stops to shrink when we reach
the degeneracy temperature.
And of course, you know it's at low temperature.
At high temperature, the gases have very similar behavior.
But at low temperature, they look very, very different.
And that can be directly observed.
We know that bosons do something very
special at low temperature.
And we talked a lot about it in this course,
namely they become superfluid and form
a Bose-Einstein condensate.
Whereas for single component fermions,
there is some interesting physics from a Fermi sea,
but nothing really special.
So in order to do something more interesting with fermions,
you need two kinds of fermions.
And two kinds of fermions can form pairs.
Just think for moment, two atoms can form a molecule.
And those bosonic pairs can condense
into a Bose-Einstein condensate and become superfluid again.
If that would be all to fermionic superfluidity,
I would be almost done right now and would say, OK,
a bosonic atom is a composite particle made of nuclei
and nucleus and electrons.
Well, a bosonic molecule is a composite particle.
But in the end, they all [INAUDIBLE] the same.
But the special things about fermions
is there is another form of pairing
which is much, much weaker.
And this is a form which leads to superconductivity
of electrons.
It's Cooper pairing.
And this is really much more subtle,
because the pairs are much larger
