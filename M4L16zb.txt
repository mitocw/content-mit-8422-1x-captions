Well, I know we had discussions about to take two beams which
form a standing wave and take it sort of apart
and calculate the force for each beam.
Well, sorry, this is what molasses is about.
Molasses is about two beams.
And if you want to treat two interfering laser
beams in the full generality, there
are a lot of other effects, some of them
we will be uncovering in the next few lectures.
But I'm happy now when I discuss beam slowing
to give you when there is only one single laser
beam, decelerating atoms.
That is the only situation I know about where you have
an exact analytic solutions.
So I want to present it to you now.
Actually, for a number of years, I presented the exact solution
with one laser beam before I presented molasses where
I have to make approximations.
But I always felt that beam slowing is more complicated
because you have to go to a decelerating frame
and have to add fictitious forces.
So some of the intuition is lost.
So that's why I first presented you with molasses
with two beams for which I need to make approximation
because interference pattern between two laser beams
has richness and complexity.
But now I discuss beam slowing with you.
So this curve here could be the result
of the very early beginnings of laser cooling in
the late '70s, early '80s.
And this is when people had an atomic beam with a Boltzmann
distribution.
And they had one laser beam counter-propagating.
But the laser beam had a fixed frequency.
And what is this laser beam doing?
Well, it resonantly interacts with the atoms,
which just have the correct Doppler shift
to be in resonance.
Those atoms are pushed, scatter photons
are pushed to lower frequencies, to lower velocities.
But they are pushed out of resonance
and eventually the slowing becomes the slower and slower.
And eventually, things come almost to a standstill.
So a laser beam which has a fixed frequency
would modify the velocity distribution
over an atomic beam in that way.
People call [INAUDIBLE] cooling.
And I think some pioneers in Russia
who did thoughts experiments were disappointed
that they were not honored with a Nobel Prize in laser cooling.
This was the first cooling because this distribution here
is considerable narrower than here and temperature is
nothing else than a measure of the width of the velocity
distribution.
But one can say that those experiments did not trigger
a revolution in atomic physics.
The evolution came when people eventually figured out
how they can narrow down this peak from maybe 100
or tens of kelvin down to million micro-kelvin.
So it's clear what is needed.
If you want to do more slowing, you
have to sort of make sure that you are talking
to the other velocities.
And if you eventually sweep many velocities into one peak,
clear out the velocity distribution,
collect all the atoms and put them
at a monochromatic velocity.
So for that, you can say, well, if you use a comb of frequency
or broad spectrum of frequencies,
you could sort of clean out a larger area.
And indeed, there are techniques like this, white light slowing
or diffuse lights slowing.
But since those techniques are not
any more of practical importance,
I don't want to discuss them.
Let me talk about the simplest technique,
at least conceptually, which is chirped slowing.
And this works like follows.
You start with a laser beam, which is initially in resonance
with the velocity group.
And as the atoms slow down, you change the detouring
of the laser that the laser stays in resonance
with the atoms.
So it is a pilot's technique, where you
have a continuous atomic beam.
You start with a laser and say, now I start slowing.
And the laser is following a group of atoms
as they are decelerated.
So you can say it is like the atoms are riding the surf.
The laser is always following the atoms
as they change the velocity.
And what is, of course, necessary for that to happen
is that the chirp and the deceleration of the atoms
are synchronized.
You will see that in a moment when I
put this idea into recreations.
There is another technique which is
used in many labs, actually, in all my labs
and Martin Zwierlein's lab.
It's called Zeeman slowing.
And this is discussed in your homework.
It is a CW version of chirped slowing.
And a lot of you know what I mean.
The physics which goes on there is almost identical.
But for conceptional reasons, it's
easier not to use magnetic fields and such.
Let's just keep it simple.
Let's have one laser beam talking to two level atom.
