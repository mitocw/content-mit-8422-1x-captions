That means that we have a heating rate.
The heating rate we just talked about, the increasing P square.
Well, if you divide by 2 times the mass,
it's an increase in kinetic energy.
So the increase in kinetic energy
is given by this expression.

And it is common if you have a heating process
to introduce a momentum diffusion
coefficient in that way.
It's just a definition.
It shows you how P square increases per unit time.
And now we can get the cooling limit for spontaneous emission,
namely by saying, in steady state when we have,
due to photons scattering, the same amount of heating
and the same amount of cooling, the temperature
will have asymptotically reached a steady state value.

The heating rate was parametrized
by momentum diffusion coefficient D over M.
So this is sort of independent of the velocity of the atom.
Where, as you remember, the cooling rate
was proportional to the energy because it
was an exponential approach to zero energy.

So therefore when we have the heating equals the cooling,
we have the energy of the atoms there.
And therefore we find that the energy
of the atoms in steady state is given by, actually,
the ratio of heating versus cooling.
It's in simple expression.
The energy or the limit in temperature for molasses
is the ratio of heating versus cooling.
Heating is described by a momentum diffusion coefficient,
and alpha is described by the damping force.
I want you actually to keep this expression in mind.
A limiting temperature in laser cooling is always--
actually in other processes in laser cooling
is the ratio of heating over cooling and momentum diffusion
coefficient due to heating over a friction
force due to cooling.
Because we will later find polarization
gradient cooling, cooling in blue molasses.
We will find other cooling schemes
where we will calculate with the appropriate model
the heating and cooling.
And I don't have to repeat this part.
The moment I calculate the heating, the momentum
diffusion, and I calculate the friction,
I know what the limit in temperature is.
Again, when I said that the energy is kT over 2,
you know of course kinetic energy
is kT over 2 times the number of degrees of freedom.
I assumed 1D here.
So in everything I've said on this page,
there are numerical factors which
may change whether you assume 1 or 2 or 3 dimension.
We had an expression for alpha.
Remember we had this Laurent's proof
the other Laurent's proof and alpha was just a slope.
I mean, everything is known, I just
didn't bother to calculate it.
But it just involves derivatives of Laurentian
And now we can ask, what is the lowest
temperature we can reach?
Well you can now analyze your expression for alpha
for a two-level system solved by the optical Bloch equation.
And you find that you will have the most favorable conditions
for low temperature, you get the minimum possible temperature
in the limit of low laser power.
And your optimum detuning is half a line widths away.
And then you find this famous result
that if you cool a two-level atom,
the limiting temperature is simply
given by the spontaneous emission rate,
or the line width of your transition gamma.
And this is the famous result for the Doppler limit.
For sodium atoms it's 250 microkelvin.
For rubidium and cesium, because of the heavier mass,
it's lower.
It's tens of microkelvin.
50 or 100 microkelvin.
So this is the famous limit.
And the physics of it is the following--
the narrower the line width is, then you can say,
the better you can cool particles down
to zero temperature-- and I think,
Jenny, your idea with the Raman process
comes, now, in very handy.
I can have an atom and I can have a Raman process where
I scatter photons and go to higher energy,
or I scatter photons and go to lower energy.
And the difference between the two processes
is actually the one that, whether I cool
or whether I heat, comes from the Doppler effect.
So the more I can discriminate through the Doppler effect,
the better I can cool.
But the Doppler effect, the Doppler shift kv--
how well I can resolve it depends on the width
of the atomic transition.
The narrower the atomic transition,
the more the Doppler effect can steer the laser cooling,
the Raman process towards lower velocity,
not towards higher velocity.
So that's an expected result, that the natural line
