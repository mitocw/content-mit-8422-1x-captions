The goal is to go from two atoms to many, many atoms which then
form a metal plate and makes the transition from forces
between neutral atoms to forces between two metal plates, which
is a famous Casimir force.
And I want you to hold the thought about what is really
the quantum aspect here?
Is it the vacuum?
Is it the zero point fluctuations
of the electromagnetic field?

Or are the atoms the zero point fluctuations
of the atomic oscillators responsible for those forces?
So we'll come back to that after we
have discussed the Casimir interaction between two
neutral plates.
So maybe one highlight for you today is that maybe in an hour
you should at least have an expert opinion
whether single point fluctuations
of the electromagnetic field are real or are just
a convenient tool to describe some physics.
But let's get them.
So the way how I want to make the transition from two
neutral atoms to two metal plates
is by reminding you that the potential was proportional
at long range to 1 over R to the 6, at short range at 1 over R
to the 6.
And if you had the model that the long range interaction
comes, because the vacuum fluctuations drive
dipole moment in the two atoms, then we
know that the potential is proportional
to the polarizability of atom 1 time
the polarizability of atom 2.
So let's now extend that to the interaction
between an atom and a wall.
Well, since I don't know--
at least not yet--
how to describe a wall, I take the position
that well, we have an atom close to a wall,
but now I extend the wall to a sphere of radius z.
And it's sort of obvious that if an atom in the x with the wall,
if the wall were flat, it is of course this part of the wall
which is most important.
So we should actually get a quantitative or
semi-quantitative result out of that.
But now I can use a nice result from electrostatics--
which I also discuss the 8421 in the M01 course--
namely when we have a conducting sphere of radius z.
Do you know what the polarizability of a sphere is?
You must have all solved this problem
in classic electrodynamics.
You apply an electric field, you calculate with a boundary
condition of the sphere.
Some spherical harmonic function.
You calculate what the dipole moment is,
and you find the proportionality constant.
It's like z squared [INAUDIBLE].
Yes, the one thing I want is that it's
proportional to z cube.
It's the volume of the sphere.
And the reason why I discuss that in atomic physics
is when we talk about the dipole moment and the polarizability
of the hydrogen atom, we find that the polarizability
of the hydrogen atom is super radius cube.
So it seems that when it comes to electric fields
and to polarizability, an atom, on hydrogen atom
behaves exactly like a conducting sphere.
And the size of this sphere is now the size of the atom.

So but that means now that the long the potential
will now be proportional to the polarizability of the atom,
and we lose three powers in the power law
because we have three powers of z
in the polarizability of the sphere.
If that worked so well once, we can now
use that at least as in ridge to discuss what happens
when we have two metal walls.
Well, we can now see we have two spheres.
And the polarizability of each sphere
is proportional to z cube.
Well, when we have two walls, we want
to use the potential per area.

So what we had is we had 1 over R to the 7.
We lose three powers of R over z because
of one sphere, another three powers of the other sphere.
So that's 1 over z.
But when we normalize by area, it becomes 1 over z squared.
And now we find that the potential is 1 over z cube.
And at least with that I have--
I wouldn't say derived, but motivated for you--
the famous Casimir potential, which is 1 over z cube.
And I want to give you an exact derivation of the Casimir
