So what appears here now for the first time is,
J. It appears here as the bandwidth,
but let me immediately give it another interpretation
as a tunneling matrix element in the following way.
Right now we have formulated the physics in block wave functions
which are infinitely extended.
The block wave functions for the lattice, what
plain waves are for free space.
But if you have tight binding limit,
there is another limit which is important, namely
a particle is localized and hops around in the lattice.
The localized particle, of course,
is in free space it would be a wave packet, a super-position
of plane waves.
So let's do the same in the lattice,
let's construct super-positions of block waves.
And these are our wave packets.
And the wave packet is now called the Wannier function.
And there is a mathematical procedure
how you should pick the phases here
to get the maximum normalization,
but the simpler picture is those Wannier functions are very,
very close to Gaussian ground state solution of the harmonic
oscillator at each side.
The wings are different, but I don't want to go into that.
It is-- you transform from an orthonormal basis of block wave
function to another orthonormal basis Wannier function
and the Wannier functions are as well localized as possible.
That's the procedure.
And now we can simply rewrite our total Hamiltonian
or everything we are interested in, not in block wave
functions, but in Wannier wave functions.
And what comes out now is that the bandwidth, J,
is nothing else than our Hamiltonian with kinetic energy
in the parody potential.
But J becomes now a matrix element
between two Wannier functions.

But the Wannier functions have now,
I'll put in some indices in a moment,
connect now two different sides.
So It is, you have one Wannier functions,
you have the Hamiltonian and connected to another Wannier
Function, so it is the amplitude that with the Hamiltonian
the particle can hop from one side to another side.
So therefore J, which was the bandwidth,
is now the tunneling energy, if divided
by H bar, the tunneling rate from one
side to the other side.
For very deep lattice everything is analytic
and can easily be solved.
And I mentioned already the tight binding approximation
you should think about Wannier function
as just localized Gaussian [? eigen ?] solutions
of the harmonic oscillator.
Yes.
So sort of qualitatively this question sounds sort of silly
but ignore them when you write down
this solution for J. We are considering the nearest
neighbor helping.
But sort of from the math, I don't immediately
see why we wouldn't include I equal to J.
Give me one more slide.
The J has an index here.
I just didn't want to overloaded with indices.
I will immediately-- I mean this is sort of just telling you
what J is in its simplest form.
It is loaded with indices.
And I will exact--
I will show you in a moment where those indices come in.
So I just wanted to give you the idea
that if you want to Wannier function.
We hop from one Wannier function to the other one
and the operator is the Hamiltonian.
And therefore, there should be an index J and L.
And maybe let me just do the next step first
and then come back to it.
But I wanted to tell you here what I'm aiming at,
namely interpretation of J of tunneling from one side
to the next.
But right now I haven't really told you which J I really mean.
There should be, based on the right-hand side,
there is a J which has two indices.
