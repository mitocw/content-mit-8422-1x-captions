The magnetic trapping potential comes
because we have a magnetic dipole moment, which interacts
with a magnetic field.
Magnetic traps are actually classical.
You can have a classical model for a magnetic trap.
And in that case, you say this potential is
mu times b times cosine theta.
Quantomechanically, of course, the angle
cosine theta is quantized and we have the different m f levels--
the different orientations of the spin
relative to the z-axis.

The fact that the magnetic field can only have minima and not
maxima means that we want to make sure
that the magnetic moment times the g factor times
m f is negative, or cosine theta is negative,
in the classical picture.
And if we absorb whatever we choose for cosine theta,
or we call mu Bohr g m f the magnetic moment,
we want that the magnetic moment of the particle
is antiparallel to the magnetic field.
Then we have a magnetic trapping potential, which is--
I've taken care of the sign now--
mu times b.
And if b has a minimum, this potential has a minimum,
and that is a magnetic trap.
But so the consequence of [? Wing's ?] theorem
is that we can only trap particles
which are antiparallel with a magnetic field.
And they can always lower their energy
by flipping to the other state.
So therefore, a magnetic trap does not
allow us to trap particles in the absolute ground state.
There is always the possibility of spin flip collisions
which lead to an antitrapped state which is expelled
from the trapping region.
Now, spin flip collisions can happen
when you have particles at sufficiently high density
and they collide.
For the experts, there can be spin relaxation,
there can be dipolar relaxation.
They're two different kinds of spin flip collisions.
Fortunately, in magnetic traps, they only
become relevant when you pick the wrong spin state.
But for suitable choices, magnetic traps
are very long-lived.
Dipolar relaxation often can be a limiting process
for both Einstein condensates, for instance
for hydrogen Bose-Einstein condensation, dipolar
relaxation limited the number and density of atoms
in the Bose-Einstein condensate.
But I don't want to talk about cold collisions here.
You should just know, based on the fundamental theorem,
you cannot trap in the ground state.
You have to trap into a state which has
more energy than other states.
In principle, it's possible to flip the spin
and go to a lower state.
Now, what we have assumed here is when I wrote the trapping
potential like this, I assume that the atom stays
in a given hyperfine state.
So we put the atom in one state and then experience
its potential.
Classically, it means that the angle
of the dipole with respect to the magnetic field
stays constant.
And this is the case due to rapid precession.
Classically, the magnetic dipole precesses
around the magnetic field.
And when the direction of the magnetic field changes,
the rapid precession keeps the dipole aligned.
Or in other words, for slow changes of the magnetic field
direction, cosine theta is an adiabatic invariant.
So the word adiabatic is important either classically
or you stay in a quantum state as long as you are adiabatic.
Well, if an atom would rapidly go
through a region of very weak magnetic field, then
the precession-- the Larmor precession-- of the atom
is very slow.
And this adiabatic condition can be violated.
And this violation of an adiabaticity condition
is called Majorana flops.
So if you operate a magnetic trap
at very low magnetic field, you may destabilize the trap
because you violate adiabaticity.
So, these are the consequences of the fact that we cannot
create maxima, we can only create minima of the magnetic
field in free space.
And therefore, we have to deal with those two possible loss
processes.
But, we have learned what kind of magnetic trap, what kind
of atom to pick.
