We have to discuss now the Bloch vector which
is the solution of the optical Bloch equation.
So now I'm going to explain you--
not all glorious details--
but the salient feature of the [INAUDIBLE].
So the density matrix has four matrix elements,
but if the sum of the diagonal matrix element
is 1, conservation of probability,
we have actually three independent matrix elements.
And those three independent matrix elements
can be parametrized by what is called the Bloch vector.
A lot of you have seen it.
We also discuss it in great detail in 8.421,
but I'm giving you the definition.
And sigma is the vector of Pauli matrices.
To be specific, the three components
of the Bloch vector are as follows--
the z component measures, you can say,
the population inversion-- the difference
between ground and excited state population.
And the x and y component measure the coherences,
either the sum of the coherences or the difference
of coherences.
And here is minus imaginary unit.
And if you replace a density matrix, or the matrix
elements sigma e e, rho e e, rho g g, by this definition,
the optical Bloch equation turns into a differential equation
for r.

It's now a differential equation for r.
And let me just write down the Hamiltonian part.

This is the equation of motion for the density matrix.
I will add on, in a minute, the relaxation part, which
comes from the master equation.
This is just the Hamiltonian part.
And this would result it into an equation of motion
for the Bloch vector, which has delta here, minus delta here,
minus g, g, and the rest of the matrix elements are 0.
The Hamiltonian, using rotation matrices,
can be written by a z rotation matrix
plus g times the x rotation.
And if you actually look at the solution--
sorry, it's sort of finite.
It's an infinitesimal rotation.
This matrix tells you that the detuning is the z rotation,
and the drive is responsible for an x rotation.

Let me tell you what happens.
You've seen the Bloch vector in many cases.
If you don't drive the system, the Bloch vector
in the ground state is down.
In the upper state, it's up.
If it's in between, that's where [INAUDIBLE] comes in.
We have a superposition of ground in the excited state.
And it rotates at the atomic frequency omega naught.
But we are in the rotating frame of the laser at omega.
So in the rotating frame, which then the frame
rotates with omega.
And omega naught rotation becomes a rotation with delta.
So therefore, the free evolution of the atom
is based on this Hamiltonian that the Bloch vector rotates
with delta in the rotating frame of the laser.
And it's a rotation around the z-axis.
If we drive the system now, we take the Bloch vector
from ground to excited.
These are Rabi oscillations.
And this is now rotation around the x-axis.
Well, whether it's x or y is a convention of notation,
and I've defined it such that the driven system is
an x rotation.
The free evolution is a z rotation.
And that's all you have to know.
This is the most general solution of a two-level system
without dissipation--
that we have two rotation angles.
One is the free rotation, which is the detuning at the z-axis.
And the driven system rotates around the x-axis.

But now we want to add what the master equation gives us.
And the master equation has the [INAUDIBLE] platform,
where we have the sigma plus jump operator.
And I told you that we have to use the following form.
You know that this gives us simply the optical Bloch
equations.
We've discussed it on Monday, that we
have now a damping, a gamma term for the population.
An excited state population decays with a rate of gamma.
And the coherences, the off-diagonal matrix elements,
decay with a rate of gamma over 2.
We spent a long time discussing this factor of 2.
So this would mean, now, that the equation for the Bloch
vector has gamma 2 terms which comes
from the dampening of the coherences.
And it has gamma, which is the damping of the population.
Well, if that would be all, everything is damped to 0.
But everything in the end leads to the ground state population.
So we have to add this term.
It's just a different way of the optical Bloch equations.
We have discussed in great length
this form of the optical Bloch equations.
And the sigma plus, sigma minus is
because these are just simple matrices with one matrix
element.

You've seen the optical Bloch equation, I think--
we did that also in 8.421-- that you
have the derivative of the density matrix includes
now damping of the off-diagonal matrix elements
by gamma over 2, damping by the diagonal matrix elements
by gamma.
And if you simply substitute the r vector
for the matrix element, you get this equation in one step.
These are the optical Bloch equations
written in terms of the Bloch vector
and no longer in terms of the density matrix.
