Then finally, let me give you a demonstration for the following
effect.
I mentioned to you that magnetic traps become unstable when
the magnetic field is very low.
And I told you [INAUDIBLE] very low magnetic field, the energy
difference between spin up and spin down is very small.
At 0 magnetic field, it becomes 0.
And then the atom cannot adiabatically stay in its MF
state because we can violate the adiabaticity condition.
So let me now show you an example of purely
classical trapping.
And I think a number of you now have seen the Levitron toy.
Actually, a few years ago when my group was one of the first
to use magnetic trapping, in every single talk
I explained how a magnetic trap worked.
And I even showed this demonstration live.
But in order to demonstrate it really well,
I was building my own Levitron.
I used machine parts.
I used a motor drive.
So I hope I can show you one aspect
of the Levitron demonstration, which is usually not known.
So let me first give you the punchline.
Magnetic trapping happens with an orientation
of the magnetic dipole, which could always lower
its energy by flipping over.
The reason why it doesn't flip over, quantum mechanically
it adiabatically stays in a quantum state.
But classically, if you have angular momentum
it is gyroscopically stabilized.
The dipole cannot flip over because it's a gyroscope.
It has angular momentum.
And actually, it also has angular momentum
in quantum physics.
So the two explanations sounded different
when I said stays in a quantum state,
is gyroscopically stabilized.
But if you think about it more deeply,
we have much more in common than my language suggests.
So I think you know how the Levitron works.
You spin up the magnet.
And I have this nice motor tool to spin it up.
And then, you have prepared the system.
Your "atom" has now-- atom in quotes--
angular momentum in a magnetic movement.
And you bring it to the position where
the three dimensional magnetic field fulfills the stability
condition.
And you can now enjoy magnetic trapping.
This is exactly what your atoms do in your magnetic trap.
It is gyroscopically stabilized magnetic levitation.
The only difference is that gravity has to be compensated.
Gravity is a major player, so the stability point
in the three dimensional magnetic field configuration
includes the compensation for gravity.
But I have to say, my group was also at some point
trapping a Bose-Einstein condensate
in a few Hertz weak trap.
The gravity was the strongest force of all.
So what you have seen is an exact demonstration
of the principle for magnetic trapping.
OK, but now comes my question.
What would you expect, what would
happen to our magnetic trap when we spin the Levitron faster?
Does it help, or does it hurt to spin up the Levitron,
to spin up the gyroscope to higher angular velocities?

So three possibility.
Nothing happens, it doesn't matter as long as it spins.
The second one, the trap becomes more stable.
The third possibility, the trap becomes unstable.
Do you want to offer any opinion?

Colin?
Well [INAUDIBLE] with a really larger magnet.
And adding applied torque is going to get a, you know,
torque [INAUDIBLE].
That's going to get a pre-factor in the magnet.
So if you have a giant [INAUDIBLE],
imagine that [INAUDIBLE] small [INAUDIBLE].

Not always [INAUDIBLE].
Never mind.
So do we have to do the experiment?
Maybe.
So now I put the motor control at full speed,
and I speed it up much faster.
You can hear the sound.
I really want to do a careful experiment.
So we wait until everything is quiet and has died out.
And now we want to try if we can do magnetic trapping.
And you see, it's impossible.
The system, when it reaches the point where magnetic trapping
would occur, it's unstable.
But then, well, just to prove that it is only
the speed of rotation which has caused the instability,
I just wait until friction has slowed down
the angular velocity.
And now, again, it works perfectly.
So you see, if you rotate the gyroscope too fast, it's bad.
It makes the magnetic trap unstable.

Convinced?
How would you explain that?

If we have a gyro--
Colin?
Why are we working in the limit where
we assume that the magnetic field generated by
are magnets [INAUDIBLE] weak compared [? to the trap? ?]
So if the magnet is really modifying the [INAUDIBLE]
like that.
No, we assume here--
and I can give you the analysis--
but no, these are permanent magnets.
So the floating magnet is just--
you can say a [? prop, ?] a test object,
which is put into the permanent magnetic field of the stronger
magnets of the stationary magnet.
[INAUDIBLE] an additional [INAUDIBLE]
to-- because if you get an additional force into the upper
[INAUDIBLE] so it gets an additional [INAUDIBLE]
in towards the center.
And then--
It's not an additional torque.
Let's put two things together.
It's really fascinating from different principles.
The first thing is magnetic trapping requires--
if you have a magnetic trap, and you have an inhomogeneous
magnetic field-- and of course, you need an inhomogeneous
magnetic field--
the angle cosine theta between the spinning dipole
and the magnetic field should stay the same.
And this means quantum mechanically,
we stay in the same quantum state.
So therefore, a magnetic trap only
works because the rapidly precessing spin when
the magnetic field always [? precesses ?]
around the magnetic field, and when the magnetic field tips,
the precession keeps the dipole, the magnetic moment,
aligned with the magnetic field.
Now, what happens in a gyroscope with a precession frequency
when you spin the gyroscope faster?

We've seen that in your classical mechanic
demonstration.
If you had the spinning gyroscope, which was only
suspended with one rope, and then it
was precessing in the Earth's magnetic field,
does this precession frequency get faster or slower
when you spin the gyroscope faster?

Pardon?
When the gyroscope spins faster?
What happens to the precession frequency?

Slower.
Because the torque per unit time adds some angular momentum.
This angular momentum adds to the existing angular momentum.
But the more angular momentum exists,
the smaller is the change, and the slower is the precession.
I can give you another example.
If you rotate a coin, when does the coin really
wobble very, very quickly?
Just when it has slowed down and is about to fall.
And this rapid wobbling the precession frequency.
So the lower the gyroscopic angular momentum is,
or angular velocity is, the faster
is the precession frequency.
And fast precession is important for adiabatic following.
So in other words, what you saw here in this demonstration
was a classical analogy for [INAUDIBLE] flux.
Now, if we were to translate from our classical
demonstration to real atom, what feature,
what parameter characterizing the atom are we changing?
So when I spin the magnet faster,
what would that correspond to in atomic properties?

[INAUDIBLE], I'm not changing the permanent magnetic moment
of the magnet by spinning it faster--
higher angular momentum.
But in this equation, what corresponds to higher angular
momentum?

[INAUDIBLE] the precession frequency
around the static [INAUDIBLE].
Yes.
But what, I mean, so the [INAUDIBLE] frequency,
this is a precession frequency, becomes lower.
So what becomes lower in the atomic property?
[INAUDIBLE] external magnetic [INAUDIBLE].
[INAUDIBLE]
No, let's not mess around with H bar here.
H bar Is given by nature.
We can't change that.
But I mean, OK, multiple choice.
B, no, no, no-- it's G, yeah, it's G. So what we have seen
is we have seen a demonstration where in front of your eyes
I've changed the atomic G factor.
And now you sort of see-- let me put it together.
What happens is the mechanical magnet
has a given magnetic moment.
And if I put much more angular momentum into it,
it can sort of--
it has, quantum mechanically speaking,
more intermediate states because it can change its angular
momentum in steps of one.
So if I spin it faster, it has many more intermediate states,
and each energy separation has become smaller.
And smaller energy separation means
I'm getting closer to degeneracy where adiabaticity breaks down.
Anyway, think about it.
The analogy is really deep.
