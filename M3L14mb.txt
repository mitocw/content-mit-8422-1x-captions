OK, we want to now discuss one other aspect, which is actually
fairly simple.
We want to discuss steady state solution.
For the steady state solution, we just
go to the differential equation and say
the left hand side is 0.
That immediately gives us a solution for the block vector.
It gives us a Lorentzian, but for strong drive
it has a term here, which we will immediately
realize that this gives us power broadening.
And then the steady state block vector
is g delta, g gamma over 2, delta
squared plus gamma squared over 4.
So we can now use this solution for steady state
and discuss everything we want what happens in steady state.
So one question is, if you have an atom laser
beam in steady state, how much light is absorbed?
Well, the basic equation is if you
have a charge q which moves in an electric field, that
means the work is done.
So therefore, the absorbed power is related to that.
And we can now combine q dr dt, and this
is nothing else than the derivative
of the dipole moment.
And then we calculate the average.
So with that, we find the result that the absorbed power,
we express now e0 by the Rabi frequency.
And h bar appears and an omega.
But the important thing is that we
need now the dipole moment, or the derivative
of the dipole moment.
And the dipole moment is given by the coherences
of the density matrix.
And that is, if you look at the substitution,
is the x and y component of the optical block vector.
But now what we need, of course, we
need only the component of the dipole moment, which
gives the non-vanishing term with cosine omega t.
That means what we need is--
I mean, it's like an harmonic oscillator--
the component of the motion, which
is responsible for absorption, is
the one which is in quadrature, which is the sine omega t
component.
And that, you have to go back and look by inspection,
but this is exactly what the y component of the block vector
does for us.
It will become important later on for optical forces.
So we have the optical block vector.

We are in the rotating frame, and the one component,
which is the x component is in phase with the light.
And the y phase is 90 degrees out of phase, as in quadrature.
And for absorption, it's of course, the in quadrature
component, which is relevant and which
determines light scattering.
OK, this is the absorbed light.
And we don't measure power in work,
we measure power in the number of absorbed photons.
This is an actual unit here, and for that we
have to divide the expression by h bar omega.
And that means now that the number of photons absorbed
per unit time is given by the Rabi frequency and the y
component of the block vector.
Well, we can ask another question,
and ask what is the number of emitted photons?
Well, the number of emitted photons
is related to the population in the excited state.
We take the population in the excited state
and multiply with gamma.
This is spontaneous emission out of the excited state.
Now the excited state can be the excited state population.
You have to look up at the substitution,
but is related to the z component of the optical block
vector.
To remind you, the z component is
the difference of population between excited and ground
state.
But the sum of the two is 1, so therefore this is now
the excited state population.
And here is our steady state solution.
Here is our steady state solution for the z component.
And by using that now, we find that we
have the result with the Lorentzian denominator.
And what we have here is gamma g squared over 4.
And now, of course, if you compare that
with the solution for y, for the number of absorbed photons,
you find--
well, it shouldn't come as a big surprise
that the number of absorbed photon in steady state
is equal to the number of emitted photon.

So this is one case of--
one important part of the solution.
And I should have shown that to you earlier.
When we look at the two components, the x and y
component, the y component is sort of absorptive,
is Lorentzian, whereas the x component is dispersive.

Just by inspection of these two expressions here, is a delta,
and the it makes the x component antisymmetric,
and the y component is symmetric with respect to the origin.
So what we see here is we have a Lorentzian.
The Lorentzian has a natural line
broadening by gamma, so the full width at half maximum is gamma,
but only in the limit of zero drive.
When we drive it, we have an additional broadening which
is called power broadening.
So for absorption, the full width at half maximum
is 2 times gamma squared over 4 plus g squared over 2.
And this last term goes by the name power broadening,
or situation broadening.
Just to avoid coming confusion, if you go to very high power,
then this term doesn't play a role.
How does the line width scale with power in power broadening?

Linear in power, quadratic in power, square root of power?
Square root.
Square root of power, yes.
So in that sense power, yes power broadening only
goes to the square root of power.
It's in essence a Rabi frequency.
If you drive the system at the Rabi frequency,
it gets power broadened by the Rabi frequency.
And I think that's the prefect, which is 2 or square root 2.
But in essence, power broadening scales with the Rabi frequency.
