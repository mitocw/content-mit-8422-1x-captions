We want to discuss, formally, the derivation of Optical Bloch
equation.
But usually when I teach you something,
I have a general concept in mind.
And the concept right now here is
how can we get from unitary time evolution of a quantum system
to [INAUDIBLE] equations anticipation.
And this is sort of the subject of master equation
open system dynamics.
And this cartoon sort of tells you what you want to do.
We have a total system, which is one part we are interested in.
And the other one, often it has many, many degrees of freedom
and we don't want to keep track of them.
But they have one Hamiltonian.
But we only interested in how our atomic system evolves
and we want to find an equation--
which is no longer a Schrodinger equation--
how does an initial density matrix describing our system
develop this time?
And as we will see, in general, it follows a master equation.
And we want to discuss what are general principles
of such equations.
What is very important here is that we are not
keeping track of what happens in the environment,
and that's associated here with a little bucket or a trash can.
Every little solid, photons or such, are measured.
The environment is constantly projected
on a measurement basis.
And therefore we introduce a probabilistic element
into the part we don't observe, namely the part which
characterizes the atoms.
So for that, we need the formalism of density matrix
and that's where we want to start.

At the end of the last lecture I reminded you
that the density density matrix can always
be written as an ensemble where you
say you have a certain probability for a certain wave
function.
This is always possible, but it is not unique.
So each of you could actually create the same density matrix
by preparing a number of quantum states
with a certain probability and saying,
this is my density matrix.
And, also, each of you has prepared different quantum
states.
If you sum them up in that way you
get the same density matrix.
And therefore all observable, all measurements
you will do on your ensemble in the future,
will be identical because the density
matrix is a full description of the system.
So at that level it may look sort of very trivial that we
have different unraveling-- unraveling means you look
microscopically what is behind the density matrix--
but in your homework assignment you will also
show that you can have a system which have very, very
different dissipation mechanisms,
but they are described by the same equation.
So therefore it's physically not possible
to distinguish by just mentioning the density matrix
what causes the dissipation.
Of course, if you know what causes the dissipation--
fluctuating fields or collisions--
you know more than the density matrix knows.

Any questions about density matrix or the agenda
we want to go through today?
