We now want to put in the fact that the force fluctuates.
And that means we have heating.
Before I do that, let me just tell you what the solution is
for force equals minus alpha times v. Well,
it means we extract energy out of the system at a rate--
well, energy per unit time is force times velocity.
Force times velocity is now minus alpha times v square,
but v square is the energy, the kinetic energy.
In other words, this equation tells us
that the atomic motion, the kinetic energy,
is exponentially [INAUDIBLE].
And if there were nothing else, you'd
just need two laser beams, optical molasses.
And you would go not just to micro-Kelvin, but to nano
and pico-Kelvin temperatures.
It's an exponential decay to absolute zero.
However, we don't reach nano and pico-Kelvin temperatures
in laswer cooling, because there are other processes.
And what is important here is spontaneous emission.
So the way you treat spontaneous emission is the following.
You know, every time an atom emits spontaneously,
there is a random momentum kick of h bar k.
If you have n photons scattered, because the momentum kicks
go in a random direction, they only
add up in a random [INAUDIBLE].
You get square root n.
Or if you ask, what is the average of p square
due to spontaneous emission?
It is the momentum of the photon squared times the number
of scattering events.
So therefore, in the form of a differential equation,
the heating rate, or the temporal derivative
of p square, goes now with the number
of photons per unit time, which is the scattering rate.
If you would stop here--
that's what many people do who explain
heating in this situation-- you would miss half of the heating,
because what you have treated here
is only the photon transfer and spontaneous emission.
However, there is also fluctuation in absorption.
I mean, just look at two atoms in the ensemble, kind of me
and another atom.
And we both scatter photons.
On average, in the same laser beam, we absorb n photons
and get n momentum kicks.
But there is the Poissonian statistics--
how many photons I absorb and how many
photons my twin brother absorbs.
So therefore, due to the randomness in absorption,
or the fluctuations in absorption,
there is another square root n variance
in the recall kicks, which comes from the absorption process.
And it so happens, for exactly that reason, that the heating--
the derivative of kinetic energy,
or the different of momentum squared due to absorption--
is exactly the same as in emission.

Well, if you now make different assumptions,
spontaneous emission has a dipole pattern,
and you get factors on the order of unity, depending
what the pattern of the spontaneous emission
is, whether you make a one-d or two-d model
of spontaneous emission, that the photons can only
go in one dimension, two dimension, or three dimension,
so you have to get other pre-factors.
But the picture is that, without going into numerical factors
on the order of unity, you have fluctuations in absorption.
You have a randomness in spontaneous emission.
