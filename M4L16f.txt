OK, you know everything which is complicated
has been approximated away now.
And now we have a very simple result.
So I'm pretty much repeating what
you have done in your homework, but now with expressions which
have still the quantum character of the Optical Bloch Equations.
So let's assume that we have an external electric field.
It's parametrized like that.
At this point, by writing it like this,
I leave it open whether we have a standing wave.
If you have a traveling wave, of course,
we have a phase vector kr, here.
If we have a standing wave, we don't have this phase vector.
So I have parametrized the electromagnetic field
in such a way that we can derive a changeable expression.
And then we will discuss what happens in a traveling wave
and what happens in the standing wave.

I make one more assumption, here,
namely that the polarization is independent of position.
I'm just lazy if I take derivatives
of the electric field.
I want to take a derivative of the amplitude
of the electric field.
And I want to take a derivative of the phase
of the electromagnetic field.
I do not want to take a derivative of the polarization.
Of course, what I'm throwing out here
is all the interesting cooling mechanisms
of polarization gradient cooling when
the polarization of the light field
spirals around in three dimensions.
We'll talk a little bit about that later on.
I just want to keep things simple here.

OK, so now if we take the gradient
of the electromagnetic field.
Finally, we have approximated everything which
complicates our life away.
And we have two terms.
One is the gradient x on the amplitude
of the electromagnetic field or the gradient x on the phase.

And since we have taken a derivative--
we take the derivative of the phase.
Because of the chain rule, the cosine changes into sine.

So therefore, the gradient of the electromagnetic field
has a cosine in-phase and an in quadrature component.
And now, for the force, we have to multiply
this with a dipole moment.
And of course, we will average over one cycle
of the electromagnetic wave.
And of course, that's what we discussed.
There is a u and v component of the block vector, which
gives rise to an in phase and in quadrature component
of the dipole moment.
And now if you combine, if you multiply
the gradient of the electric field with the dipole moment.
And average the cosine part goes with the cosine part,
the sine part goes with the sine part.
And the cos terms average out.
So therefore, we have the simple result
that we have two contributions to the optical,
to the mechanical force of light.
And the u component, the in-phase component
of the dipole moment goes with the amplitude of the gradient.
And the in quadrature component goes
with the gradient of the phase.
So in other words, when it comes to light forces,
the cosine component and design component of the dipole moment
talk actually to two different quantities associated
with the electromagnetic field.
It's just in-phase and in- quadrature.
OK, now so this is--

now I just have to tell you a few definitions and names.
This component, which goes with the in-phase component
is called the reactive force.
Whereas the other one is called the dissipative force.
The name, of course, comes that if you have an harmonic
oscillator, the component which oscillates in quadrature
absorbs directly energy.
Whereas the in-phase component does not absorb energy.
I leave it for a little bit later
in our discussion, how you can have a force and not
exchange energy.
That's a little bit of a mystery when
we talk about cooling with a reactive force.
We will have to look, scrutinize what happens with energy.
Because at least in the most basic way,
the in-phase component of the oscillating system
does not extract energy from the electromagnetic field.
So maybe just believe that for now
when we look and maybe scrutinize it later.
Any questions?
So we have now obtained the reactive force, which is also
called the dipole force or stimulated force,
and the dissipative force, which is also
called the spontaneous force.
The next thing is purely nomenclature.
We want to introduce appropriate vectors
which point along the gradient of the phase
and which point along the gradient of the amplitude.
And this is done here.
So we want to say that the reactive
and the dissipative force are written
in a very sort of similar way.
But one of them points in the direction
of a vector alpha, the other one in the direction of a vector
beta.
The beta vector is the gradient of the phase.
If the phase is kr, the gradient of the phase
is simply k, the k vector of the electromagnetic wave.
So that will come in handy in just a few seconds.
Whereas the reactive force points
into the direction of the gradient of the amplitude.
But we never want to talk about electromagnetic field
amplitude.
For us, we always use the electric field
in terms of the parametrized rabi frequency.
The rabi frequency is really the atomic unit
of the electric field.
So therefore, this vector which involves now
the gradient of the amplitude, becomes a normalized gradient
of the rabi frequency.
So these are the two fundamental light forces, the reactive
