OK.
We had a discussion last time about we have the force,
we find exactly what happens to the atoms,
but we may have to think about it in different ways
to figure out where the kinetic energy goes from.
And I think I mentioned it already in the last class
that what happens is you have a [INAUDIBLE] laser, which
is the photons I absorbed.
But the atom is scattering light in all directions.
And so if you go 90 degrees, you don't have a linear Doppler
shift.
If you go forward, backward with the same probability
as geometric pattern, the Doppler shift averages to 0.
So in average, you emit photons, which are on resonance.
And therefore, every time you scatter a photon,
you radiate away the energy which
is equal to the Doppler shift.

That means initially when the Doppler shift is huge,
each photon transports away a lot of energy.
And this lower the atoms are, the less the photon
transports away.
But that makes sense.
If you have a huge velocity and you subtract h by k,
the momentum of the photon, the kinetic energy
is quadratic in velocity.
The h by k, the momentum transfer of a photon
takes out more kinetic energy the faster
the velocity of the atoms is.
So everything makes sense.
It is consistent.
