I want to wrap up the discussion of the stimulated light force
by discussing pretty much everything again,
but in the simplest possible limit.
That's actually something I haven't found in any textbooks,
but when I derived it for myself, I--
it helped me to really understand it.
It's sort of the perturbative result of the dressed atom
picture.
So everything is simpler.
And by telling you, look at this,
you know this is just the easiest [? arc shift, ?]
but in the dressed atom picture, it's a generalized Rayleigh
frequency.
You suddenly understand the trivial perturbative result
and how it translates into the dressed atom picture.
So what I'm presenting you now, in the next 10 minutes,
it provides a lot of insight, because it
connects simple pictures.
So-- so I'm discussing things here
in the limit that the detuning is large.
The detuning is larger than the Rayleigh frequency
and spontaneous emission rate is the smallest of the three
rates.
In that case, I can simply do perturbation theory.
And I want to show you.
Also because this is pedagogical,
I just want to show you how the effects come together.
I neglect all factors on the order of unity.
And I set each part to one.
OK, so let's assume we have a standing wave.
A standing wave is cosine a x and--

So we have an electric field but we describe the electric field
with a Rayleigh frequency, so the Rayleigh frequency
forms a standing wave.
Now what are the two dressed states?
The dressed states 1 and 2 are the bare states grounding
the excited state.
And then there is a perturbative mixture.
And in first order perturbation theory,
we take the matrix element over the detuning.
So one dressed state is the ground state with a little bit
of excited state mixed.
The other dressed state is the excited state
minus sign the little bit of ground state mixed.
These are our two dressed states in the trivial limit--
trivial limit that we can apply perturbation theory.
OK, what are now the transition rates between the two
dressed states?
Well, we want to make spontaneous emission
from dressed state 1 to dressed state 2.
We have to go from this small admixture, which
is the excited state admixture, to the ground state here.
So therefore, we get the product of the two amplitudes,
and then we multiply with gamma.
Of course, most of--
yeah, so this is the rate to go from dressed state
1 to dressed state 2.
What is the inverse rate to go back from dressed state
2 to dressed state 1?
Well, you go from the excited state to the ground state,
multiply with gamma, and that's what you get.
Sure, we have, in perturbation theory, the coefficient is 1.
It's only in higher order perturbation theory
that the co-efficient of the bare state becomes less than 1.
So isn't that simple?
I mean, we just discussed it with all the cosine
to the fore or sine to the fore.
But now in perturbation theory, this
is surveyed for going from dressed state 1 to 2.
And this is surveyed to go the other way around.
So what is our dressed state potential?
Well, the dressed potential is simply
the AC Stark shift, which is opposite for the ground
and for the excited state.
And the AC Stark shift in perturbation theory
is nothing else than matrix elements [INAUDIBLE]
over detuning.
So this is u-naught This is the potential of the standing
wave experienced by the atom.

OK, now we want to do Sisyphus cooling.
What is the cooling rate in Sisyphus cooling?
Well, remember Sisyphus cooling--
we assume that the atom is fast enough to go over several hills
and valleys.
The cooling rate is determined by the rate
at which the atoms reach dressed levels times u-naught.
And I can scroll back, but u-naught
will see AC Stark effect and gamma 1, 2
was this expression we had before.
So therefore, in this simple picture,
where everything is perturbative,
we have a nice expression for the cooling rate.
Well, now let's get something non-trivial out of it.
What is the friction coefficient?
Well, in many situations I've plotted for you--
the force versus velocity.
Now I want to plot for you the cooling rate versus velocity.
That means it's force times velocity.
And, as we just discussed, when the velocity
is sufficiently fast, that the atom
can go over several hills and valleys
in a spontaneous lifetime.
The cooling rate will saturate at--
because it is limited by the rate at which the atom switches
between dressed levels.

OK, but now the question is, if you
want to understand what happens at low velocities,
how should we connect the two?
Well, you can say we know, for analytical reasons,
that the force versus velocity has to be linear.
So the cooling rate, which is another power of velocity,
should be quadratic.
And since I neglect all factors on the order of unity,
this is now--
the force is friction coefficient times v. So
therefore, what I drew in red here is
a parabolic approximation, which is alpha--
the cooling rate-- times v-square.
And now if I want to know what is alpha,
I just sort of connect this parabola
with the saturated value, which I know.
And I know the transition happens at the velocity when
the atom moves further than 1 wavelength in one
spontaneous emission time.
So, therefore, based on this very physical picture
and on the inside--
How low velocities and high velocities connect together--
I can actually obtain the friction coefficient
in this [INAUDIBLE] standing wave by taking the cooling rate
and dividing it by the velocity at which the atom moves
1 wavelength per spontaneous emission time.

And if I do that, I obtain this result,
which I have already quoted earlier to you from the paper
of [INAUDIBLE].
It looks fairly non-trivial with power to the 6, power to the 5.
But this is now the simple perturbative results
