In atomic physics we have a wonderful tool
to study pairing because atoms can form molecules--
weakly bound molecules or tightly bound molecules--
and we can control that in experiments
with the Feshbach resonance.
Assume you have two atoms which collide
and they can form a molecule.
And if you apply a magnetic field,
the two free atoms and the molecule
may have a different Zeeman shift
and therefore, there may be a level crossing.
This is called, as a function of magnetic field,
the Feshbach resonance.
If the crossing is a crossing, nothing
happens because the two configurations would not
interact.
Physics happens when there are interactions,
for some hyperfine copying for instance,
which takes the crossing into an anti-crossing.
And now you see the following physics
around this Feshbach resonance, that we have two atoms here.
Here we have a stable molecule--
now there are many, many more molecular states down there--
but for this restricted Hubert space--
this is the lowest state it's a stable molecule--

the atoms, if you compare the solid line
with the dashed line, attract each other
because the solid line has lower energy,
whereas on the other side of the Feshbach resonance
they repel each other.
So therefore, if you look at the scattering
links or the normalized force between atoms,
we find this dispersive feature around the Feshbach resonance.
Atomic physics wouldn't be the same
without Feshbach resonances, we can now
tune attractive- repulsive interactions.
In a richer situation there may also
be single crossings of their scattering links, which
allows us to realize non-interacting systems
and such.
And Feshbach resonance were first observed at MIT
some 15 years ago.
So coming back to fermions, this Feshbach resonance
gives us something very interesting
regarding to pairing.
On that side, where we have stable molecules,
those molecules are bosons, and those bosons
form a Bose-Einstein condensate of bound pairs.
Over here we have attraction, but the attraction is not
strong enough to form a bound state,
at least two atoms in vacuum would not
form a molecular state, the attraction is too weak.
But we know from condensed metaphysics textbook,
if you have many fermions, if you have a fermi sea,
then a fermi sea plus attraction equals BCS Cooper pairs.
So now we have an opportunity, by simply changing
the magnetic field, to go form real strongly bound pairs,
to weakly bound pairs, and eventually
to Cooper pairs, which would not form pairs in vacuum.
And this is the kind of physics, which
was for the first time explored with [INAUDIBLE] atoms
in the BEC- BCS crossover.
Jenny?
Just to clarify, so in the repulsive regime,
you said that atoms form molecules,
but that atoms repel each other.
So you're saying that atoms that don't form molecules
repel each other or even [INAUDIBLE]?
Yeah, if I go back to that, here they form molecules,
here they repel each other.
And actually, a lot of people think
the repulsive side on the repulsive side of the Feshbach
resonance means there is repulsion.
But look, the atoms attract each other so much
that they form a molecule.
You can actually see the repulsion of the atoms
comes because there is a very attractive moleculer
state below and those two states repel each other.
So the repulsion up here is actually
caused by the molecular stay down there.
So in other words, if you go from
the attractive to the repulsive side,
many people use it, in terms of pairs
you go actually form very weak attraction, which is not
sufficient to form a bound state to stronger
and stronger attraction which now forms a stronger and more
strongly bound molecule.
Mark?
Are there ways you can tell whether the molecule
[INAUDIBLE] were attracted just by physics?

You mean what the force is between the molecules now?
It turns out that the molecules are repulsive.
In some picture here, when the molecule forms,
you can see it's a loosely bound molecule
and the repulsion between atoms turns
into repulsion of molecules.
If you use a naive theory, which has approximations,
you would actually find that the scattering length for molecules
is exactly two times the scattering length for atoms.
But if you work it out correctly the factor
is different then, too.
Colin?
So, you said that the molecules are bosons?
Yes
I guess they're only bosons if the size of the molecule--
I'll come to that later.
We'll come to that later.
Yes?
My question was, I guess the size of the molecule scales
pretty strongly with how far away you have a resonancy
[INAUDIBLE]--

In the universal regime which is open channel dominated--
sorry for talking shop--
in that regime, the size of the molecule
is equal to one half of the scattering lengths.
So as the scattering links diverge
the molecule is very, very big, and as we move away,
the molecule gets smaller and smaller.
But once we get out of this quadratic regime,
out of the universal, the halo regime, then of course
the molecular size is completely determined by the closed
channel and it is whatever it is in the closed channel
and there's no relation to the scattering lengths.
