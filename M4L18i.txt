What is the cooling limit for evaporative cooling?
When we talked about laser cooling,
I derived for you the Doppler limit.
And we talked about even improved cooling limits
when we discussed some Doppler and some recoil cooling.
So what is the cooling limit for evaporative cooling?
Well, the answer is there is no fundamental limit.
It's there is no sort of h bar or quantized limit there.
There is a practical limit that, which
usually depends on residual heating or inelastic collisions
and all that.
But we have reached an evaporative
cooling temperatures as low as 400 pico Kelvin.
And the limit was not set by anything fundamental,
it was more set by our patience.
The lower the temperature, the slower
the process becomes, and also by the sensitivity
to technical noise and technical [INAUDIBLE].

Of course, just a final comment which
is a segue to what we hopefully do on Friday.
For evaporative cooling, I've always
assumed that the energy is--
that the energy in the trap is continuous.
In other words, if you have an harmonic oscillator trap--
trapping potential, I've neglected the discrete level
structure.
And this is an excellent approximation
because many, many atom traps have just frequencies
of a few Hertz or kilo Hertz.
And at very low temperature, even
at non-operative temperatures, you populate many levels.
When it comes to the discrete nature of trapping levels,
we should use a quantum description of the motion
of atoms in the trap.
And this is the regime of sideband cooling.
Sideband cooling is much more important
for ions, charged particles and for neutral atoms.
So therefore, we will discuss sideband cooling on Friday
