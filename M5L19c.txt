When we have diagonalized the Hamiltonian,
we know everything we want to know.
I just focused on the quasi-particle energies,
but you also know the ground state energy.
And actually here, Colin, you see
that the corrections to the ground state energy
scale with N-A cubed.
So this is really the small parameter in the system.
But we can also find out what is the ground state wave function,
and let me use that to introduce an important concept to you,
called the quantum depletion.
When you have two atoms in the condensate
at zero momentum and you switch on the interactions the atoms--
the interaction, the delta function interaction
couples zero momentum state to higher momentum states.
So therefore the effect of interactions
is that the condensate is not just at zero momentum,
it has some probability or some admixture of finite momentum
states.
This is the ground state.
This is how the Hamiltonian is diagonalized.
So from the Bogoliubov approximation
where we introduced this we and you parameter
to transfer from one set of Boser operators
to another set of Boser operators,
those coefficients give us the population
of those momentum states in the counsel of the condensate.
So if I now ask, what is the condensate fraction?
What is the number of atoms in the zero momentum states?
It's all atoms, but those who have finite momentum.
And we find again this small parameter N-A cubed.
Now this quantum depletion allows me now
to make a difference, a distinction,
between the cold atomic gas condensates
and superfluid helium 4.
In cold atomic gas condensates, this correction is about 1%.
So therefore, I can say, with 99% probability,
or with 99% weight, the condensate, the many body wave
function of the condensate is just a zero momentum
state to the way N. And this very complicated admixture
of correlations into the ideal gas wave function is only 1%
for alkali gases.
But for liquid helium, the condensate
fraction even at zero temperatures only 10%.
So when people use neutron scattering,
it would be a long story in itself how this is done,
but when they use neutron scattering
to analyze liquid helium at low temperature
and figure out what is the fraction of atoms which have
zero momentum, they found 10%.
The quantum depletion is 90%.
But that's just the difference between a current gas
and a quantum liquid.
And in the quantum liquid, in liquid helium N-A cubed
is on the order of unity.
