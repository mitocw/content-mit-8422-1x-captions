We have two fundamental forces--
the electric force.
And if you have two charges separated
and they field two different electric field--
we derive from The Coulomb force, the dipole force,
and the force on the electric dipole is--
the potential is d dot E, the gradient of it
is d times gradient E. With correct factorial notation.
Whereas the Lorentz force is V cos B.
So these are the two forces we have to consider.
Let me show two configurations where we use dipole forces--
the stimulated light force.
One is here, where we focus a laser beam.
And let's just assume, for the sake of the discussion,
that the laser beam--
it's propagating here and the linear polarization
goes up and down.
So now we have a dipole movement of the atom which
oscillates up and down, which is parallel to the electric field.
So now we have d dot E, and indeed, if you take the atom
and move it into the laser beam, it
will experience an attractive force.
And this attractive force is purely electric.

But let's now come to the situation which many of you
work on in the laboratory.
That we have two-plane waves, so the laser beams
are infinitely extended.
We have two-plane waves, and they form an optical lattice.
Now the dipole-- the oscillating dipole,
the electric dipole-- is again driven
by linearly polarized light.
It points up.
But the gradient of the electric field
is in the direction of the interference of the lattice.
So the gradient of the electric field
is perpendicular to the dipole movement.
So therefore, d dot E is exactly 0.
And therefore the electric part of the potential,
the Coulomb force--
which is microscopically behind it--
will not contribute anything.
So I could stop here and say, well, OK.
Since we have only the Coulomb force and the Lorentz force.
I've proven to you it's not the Coulomb force,
so therefore it's the Lorentz force.
But let me just tell you why.
So what I'm really telling you is,
it is actually remarkable that if we go along the z direction,
and we take the z derivative of the AC Stark shift potential,
and the AC Stark shift potential is 1/2.
Alpha is now the polarizability--
we use alpha in many places--
times E square.
So this is the AC Stark shift potential,
and the spatial derivative of the AC Stark shift potential
is a force, but it's the Lorentz force.
Actually, I was amazed.
I had to work it out myself, because I hadn't
seen it is discussed anywhere.
But you can simply take the electric field of a standing
wave, perform this derivative, and what you find
is you get the Lorentz force.
If you wonder how you get it, without going
for all the vectorial notation, the Lorentz force
is V cos B. The velocity of the charge
is related to the derivative of the dipole movement.
The dipole movement is charge times position,
and the derivative of the dipole moment
is charge times velocity.
So don't let yourself fool yourself when
you have an oscillating field.
There are charges which move--
there are currents inside the atom.
So our V cos B, the V is pretty much the dot,
the d dot is polarizability times E dot,
and this is alpha polarizability,
frequency times electric field.
But as Cody said, we can go from p dot A to d dot E,
or to be precise, the magnetic field
is the curl of the vector potential.
And the curl gives us the wave factor k--
I'm suppressing factorial notation here--
and you know that E--
the electric field-- is the temporal derivative of a.
So therefore we get that.
So if you now multiply d dot with the curl of A
you get something which is k alpha E square.
k is for standing wave, the spatial derivative.
So I've shown you-- at least you can see by dimensional
analysis, or by just pointing to the different terms--
that if you take the AC Stark shift
potential to the derivative, you get everything which
you have in the Lorentz Force.

It would be a 10 minute easy homework assignment--
but we are running out of homework assignments.
We're at the end of the semester--
to show that explicitly.
So it is really the Lorentz force
which provides the trapping potential
in an optical lattice.

Questions?
Boris.
So in the simple picture of the lattice,
you're saying that the transverse confinement is
provided by the electric force?
But what about [INAUDIBLE] direction?
Say I've got an electric field like this
at the other direction?
OK, I can discuss with you two simple geometries.
In one case, in one direction, it's
the pure Coulomb force at work, in the other direction
it's the pure Lorentz force.
But in general, when you go through an AC Stark shift
potential, you have both.
So you may wonder that the Coulomb
force, when you integrate it, would not be integrable.
It does not give rise to potential.
Also the Lorentz force does not give rise to potential.
But if you add the Coulomb force and the Lorentz force,
you can integrate it up to the optical dipole potential.
I find it remarkable, but it is what it is.
