Let's now come to the third aspect
of master equation solutions of optical bloch or master
equations.
And these are damped vacuum Rabi oscillations.
I really like this example in this chapter.
So I hope, well, I think we have many highlights.
But this is sort of a really nice example.
I learned it from Professor Schwann when he introduced it.
And what I like about it is I can
use it to show you what other Lindblad operators may
be important.
So you suddenly understand in a bigger context
what the master equation is.
And then we continue with an atom in a cavity.
And the damping is no longer by spontaneous emission.
The damping is by photons sneaking out of the cavity.
So we really learn something which
is similar to optical bloch equation,
but in another context.
And often if you see two different realizations
of similar physics, you maybe realize
more what is more generic and what is special,
for instance with spontaneous emission.
So I really like that.
But also, I found that this example
allows me to introduce to you the concept of the quantum Zeno
effect, and the concept of adiabatic elimination
of coherences.
So it's a wonderful example which
connects us with a number of really neat concepts.
So with that promise, let me remind you
that in the master equation, when we derived it,
we got an exact expression, when did second order--
when we did second order perturbation theory.
And this structure, which came, was this double commutator
between the interaction operator and the statistical operator.
Just to remind you, in the interaction picture--
first, in the non-interacting, in the normal picture,
the derivative of the density matrix
is the commutator with h.
And in the interaction picture, it's
a commutator with v with the interaction.
But when we iterate an equation to second order,
we pluck the first result into the equation.
Then we get, in second order, the structure.
And by expanding the commutator, we
obtain the following structure.
And that gives rise to the Lindblad form
of the master equation, which is rho dot equals a Hamiltonian
part.
But then, we have now a sum, v. The interaction
with the environment can be a sum of, you know, mu dot b--
sorry, an external b field times magnetization,
and dipole moment times an electric field.
It can have a number of terms.
And therefore, in general, we have more than one Lindblad
operator.
But the structure is always given by this commutator
in the following form.
OK, so we had this general derivation,
but until now, we have only looked
at a system which is a simple atom,
and the environment was the vacuum.
So this is our environment.
And also, the environment was always in the vacuum state.
So these were our assumptions.
And that means that the only Lindblad operator,
the only jump operator in this sum
is sigma minus for spontaneous emission.
And by inserting this jump operator
into the Lindblad form of the master equation,
we find the optical bloch equation.
