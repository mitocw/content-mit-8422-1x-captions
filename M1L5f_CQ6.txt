OK, now finally, now we can define the beam splitters.
So so far we have really just repeated
a little bit the definitions of classical or non-classic,
like what are coherent states.
We measure current in-- we know now
in what units we measure the current.
And we characterize the fluctuations
in variance, not in standard deviation
for the rest of this unit.
But now we learn the coherent state for beam splitter.
And we have two photodiodes, one, i1 and one, i2.
And we measure the current i1.
What is the variance now in the current you measure?
