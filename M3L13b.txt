Just a quick reminder--
since this was covered in 8.421 and most of you know about it,
I prewrote the slides.
The density matrix is a time evolution.
There is one which is sort of trivial, and covered
in more elementary text, and this
is the Hamiltonian evolution.
And I'm sure you've seen it.
The time evolution, the unitary time evolution,
involves the commutator of the Hamiltonian
with the density matrix.
And later on, we want to specialize,
including dissipation, including the environment,
to the evolution of a two-level system driven
by a monochromatic field.
And this is the famous Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian.
And we can characterize this system by a density matrix.
What will be very important is that we distinguish
between populations-- the diagonal parts
and the coherences.
And if you simply put this density matrix
into this equation, you find the time evolution of the system.
And we will refer to that result later on.
Many of you have seen it in 8.421.
We can parameterize the density matrix
for the two-level system.
So we can parameterize the density matrix
for two-level system by a Bloch vector r, which
is defined by this equation.
And then the equation of motion is simply
the rotation of a Bloch vector on the Bloch sphere.
And it has a rotational axis which
is given by the undriven system rotates around the z-axis.
This is just e to the i omega naught t, the normal evolution
of the free system.
But if you drive it with a monochromatic field,
we have a rotation over the x-axis.
And the x-axis, of course, can take your two-level system
and flip it from the ground to the excited state.
So that's just a reminder of the simple unitary time evolution.
