The next chapter is called Derivation of the optical Bloch
equation.
What we really need for a number of phenomenon
in AMO physics for laser cooling,
light forces, and much more are the optical Bloch equations.
But what I try in this chapter to give you sort of the story,
the profound, story the fundamental insight
behind the optical Bloch equations.
Because what the optical Bloch equations are
is the following-- we want to describe a quantum system.
But the quantum system is coupled to the environment.
And that means we have dissipation.
And this is something which is not easily dealt
with in simple quantum physics, because a simple quantum
system undergoes unitary time evolution described
by an Hamiltonian.
And unitary time evolution does not allow entropy to increase,
does not allow energies to be exchanged.
So a lot of things which happen in our experiments
and in daily life come because the system we are looking at,
it follows Schrodinger's equation,
but it is coupled to a much bigger system.
And so in this section, what I want
to address at the most fundamental limit is, what
is this step where we go from reversible equation,
unitary time evolution, to something which is called
relaxation, which is dissipative,
where entropy is increased?
And this step, of course, is we go from pure states
to statistical operators.
We describe a big system, but then we
focus on the small system.
And I want to show you, first with a simple example,
but next week in more generality,
how this completely changes the nature of the description
of the small system.
A small system which was just described
by Schrodinger's equation now follows the density matrix
equation, has relaxation, the entropy increases, and such.
To maybe set the stage, one of the simplest system
we can imagine is James Cummings' model,
that we have an atom in a cavity interacting with one
or mode of the radiation field.
And in this course in Part One, we've dealt with it,
and looked at vacuum Rabi oscillation
if you really need things.
But what happens is that the system is an open quantum
system.
You can have spontaneous emission.
And if your mirrors are not 100.00% reflectivity,
some light leaks out.
So in other words, we have coupling to the environment.
Of course, we can say we simply describe it.
We have our atoms, maybe one mode and plus
the one mode of the electromagnetic field.
And then we have the environment,
which may consist of photons which are leaking out
and photons which are spontaneously emitted.
So this is our system.
And of course, if you write down the total Hamiltonian
and do the time evolution, something
will come out which in general, is very complicated, very
entangled.
The atom is entangled.
The atom moving to the left side is
entangled with a photon which was emitted to the right side,
and the recoil of the photons push the atom.
So you have now to keep track of all the photons
which have been scattered in the lifetime of an atom.
So you can do that.
And you do that by propagating the system
with its total Hamiltonian.
But often, what we do is we simply
put the photons in a trash can.
We trash them. we're not interested what
the photons are doing.
We're not keeping track of them.
Actually, they hit the wall of our vacuum chamber,
and we couldn't even keep track of them.
The vacuum chamber has taken care of them.
So all that we are interested in,
how do we now describe the atomic system?
What after the time evolution is now the density matrix
of the system?

Of course, if we use the full description--
we know the initial state of the environment,
we know the initial state of our system,
we propagate it exactly with the correct time evolution,
we get everything, and then we could reduce
by doing a partial trace.
We could reduce a description.
What is now the probabilistic description for the density
matrix of the atom?
But this is rather complicated.
What we want to do is, we do it as a derivation,
but in the end, we want to have a formulation which simply
tells us what is the atomic density
matrix as a function of the initial atomic density matrix?
So in other words, all that, what happens with
the environment-- that there is an initial state,
that it gets entangled, and then we neglect,
we're not keeping track of the photons--
we are not interested in all that.
We really want to focus on what happens to the atom.
How does an initial state of the atom
propagate into a final state?
And this is done by optical Bloch equations.
This is done by the master equation.
So the master equation, as you can see,
focuses on the relevant part of the system, maybe just
a single atom.
And we can neglect the million photons
which have been emitted.
But those million photons which have
been emitted into the environment, they
change, of course, the density matrix of the atom.
And if you find a description, the master equation
is including, with extra terms, what those photons have done.
Maybe this sounds very abstract, but in the end,
you will find that maybe photons which emitted
produce some damping.
Or if you put atoms in molasses, the atomic motion
comes to a standstill.
So in other words, we want to develop
a systematic approximation scheme for the master equation,
where the effect of all these many, many degrees of freedom
can maybe be simply expressed by a few damping terms.
So that's the idea.
So you know already one example of a master equation.
And these are Einstein's rate equations,
which we have discussed in the first part of the course.
If you have a two-level system, which
is coupled to the radiation field,
then we obtain the equations that the rate of change
of the ground state population is related to the excited state
population through spontaneous emission
described by the Einstein A coefficient.
And if you have a spectral density
of the electromagnetic field, it causes stimulated emission,
and it causes absorption described by the Einstein A
coefficient.
And you have a similar equation for the excited state.
So this is clearly the semi-classical limit
of what we want to accomplish.
But we want to know more.
We really want to know not just what is
the rate equation for the atom.
We want to know, you can say, the wave function.
Well, wave function slash statistical operator--
the statistical operator contains all information
of the wave function.
And if the wave function is a pure state,
it has a certain statistical operator.
And we can find the pure state, so that's what we want to do.
But sort of just generically, we really
want to find the full quantum time evolution.
And now, I just want to express that.
We have to be careful.
The time evolution, as an Hamiltonian,
if you now bring in the environment,
cannot be simply included by adding an imaginary term.
This here violates the unitary time evolution.
In other words, when we find an equation for the quantum
system, how it evolves, it's not that everything
you think which phenomenologically works will
work.
It has to be consistent with the laws of quantum physics.
In other words, when we find an equation which
describes the atomic system, it will be a requirement
that a density matrix turns into a density matrix.
So a certain structure has to be obeyed,
and that is actually extremely restrictive.
And our derivation of the master equation
will actually show what kind of operators applied
to the atomic density matrix are consistent, are quantum
mechanically consistent.
This is actually something which is a frontier of our field,
both in theory and ion traps and with neutral atoms--
that we have some evolution of an atomic system
by coupling it with the environment.
Well, the usual environment you can think of
is just taking photons away.
It gives us a damping term of the excited state.
But now you can ask the question,
can you construct an environment which
has some degrees of freedom with laser fields, RF
fields and such?
You call it the environment.
And this environment does something really fancy.
And a system comes in equilibrium
with the environment.
But could you engineer the environment
that the system comes into equilibrium
with the environment, and it is in a fancy super fluid
or fancy entangled state?
So can you engineer the environment in such a way
that it does something really fancy to your system?
Well, you can dream of it, but your dreams
are restricted by the mathematical structure
of all possible master equations in the world.
Because the environment cannot do everything for you.
The environment can only do for you what can come out
of all possible Hamiltonians.
And the fact that the total system
evolves in a unitary way with a total Hamiltonian
of the system, this is really restricting.
This operator that sort of stands for all possible master
equations is restricting the master equation
for your atomic density matrix.
There was just, I think, this year or last year,
a nice Science or Nature paper by Rainer Blatt's group
in Innsbruck, where they engineered the environment
around ions in an ion trap.
And that stabilized the ion in a state
which was an unusual state, not what the normally environment
would have done.
So anyway, what I've been telling you
is also sort of relevant to understand
this sort of frontier in our field,
which is called "environment engineering."
So what we have is, we have a system.
And we have this environment.
And what we are exchanging with the environment
is both energy, but also entropy.
So when we transfer energy or heat,
there is a corresponding change in entropy.
And it is a general property of all quantum systems.
It's a consequence of the fluctuation dissipation
principle, the fluctuation dissipation theorem,
that you cannot have any form of relaxation without noise.

So for instance, when we discuss optical molasses--
we do that in a few weeks--
where the atomic motion is damped,
you have a damping term.
It brings the motion, through friction, to a standstill.
But we know by general principles
that damping is not possible without noise.
So when somebody sells you a wonderful damping scheme which
damps the motion, you should always ask,
but there must be noise.
What is the ultimate noise?
And it's fundamental that it is there.
So therefore, our derivation of the master equation
will also display that-- that we will not
get any form of damping without at least the fundamental
quantum noise.
So what we need is a description of the quantum
noise, which comes from coupling to the environment.
The tool which we use for that is the density matrix.
I assume everybody here is familiar with the density
matrix.
The atomic lecture notes on the wiki
have a small tutorial on the density matrix.
If you want to fresh up your knowledge about density matrix,
maybe read about it.
I don't want to cover it in class.
The one thing we need, and I just want to remind you,
is that for all the density matrices,
you can always unravel it--
that the density matrix can be written as a probabilistic sum
over states.
This will actually play a major role.
We will make certain models for damping.
And it's really beautiful.
On Monday, I will give you the beam splitter model
for the optical Bloch equation.
I really like it, because it's a microscopic model,
and it shows you a lot of fundamental principles.
But the important part is, whenever
we have a way to construct a density matrix by saying
we have certain quantum states, k,
and we just add them up probabilistically,
this kind of microscopic interpretation of the density
matrix is called unravelling.
It's sort of writing it as a specific diagonal sum
over states.
But those unravelings are not unique.
They describe one possibility, but there
are other possibilities.
And the one example which I can give you
is that if you have a density the like this,
you can write the density matrix, as this form suggests,
as a probabilistic sum of being in the state 0, 0
or in the state 1, 1, with probability 1/4 and 3/4.
But you can also write it as being with equal probability
in two states, a and b, where the states a and b
are superpositions of state 0 and 1.
And you can see by inspection that this will do the trick.
So we'll talk a lot about unraveling
of the density matrix.
But I want to say upfront that the same density
matrix can be thought of as being
created by different processes.
But this actually makes it even more powerful,
because we have a unified description, or even
an identical description, for different microscopic
processes.
OK, any last question?
