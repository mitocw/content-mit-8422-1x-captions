OK, let me just generalize the thought.
But I think you know already everything about it.
We talked about the master equation.
We talked about the most general master equation
in the [INAUDIBLE] platform, where those operators l
are the jump operators.
And the prominent example for jump operator
was the sigma minus operator, which
takes a particle from the excited state to the ground
state.
And this is a jump operator for spontaneous ignition.
But you may have many jump operators, maybe
spontaneous emission of different photons
with different polarization and such,
or the cavity may lose a photon, and then
we have a jump operator for the cavity.
We went through that.
Well, that means now in an exact way
that the [INAUDIBLE] Hamiltonian is the original Hamiltonian
with an imaginary part, which comes because of those jump
operators.
And the general Quantum Monte-Carlo Wave Function
procedure is that first, you ask, has something happened?
Has any jump happened?
And this gives you the probability delta p.
And if no jump has happened, you just do a time evolution
with a [INAUDIBLE] Hamiltonian.
But if a jump has happened, then the jump is now--
the wave function is projected by the jump operator.
If you have a sigma minus operator,
it takes a particle to the ground state.
If you have several operators, a different jump operator
may take your particle to another state.
And you have then a branching ratio
that you know first the jump has happened.
And then the question is which jump has happened.
And you just play the probabilistic game.
So you see that the Quantum Monte-Carlo Wave Function
method can be immediately be generalized.
