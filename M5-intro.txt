Welcome to Module 5 of the course Atomic and Optical
Physics.
Wow, I can't believe it's the last module of this course.
And it's an exciting module.
We will be discussing ultracold Bose and Fermi gases,
and quantum computation with trapped ions.
Those are three of the main frontiers
of atomic and optical physics.
So now we apply almost everything
we have learned in this course to frontiers in research.
Now, ultracold Bose and Fermi gases and quantum computation--
each of them could be its own course.
So in this module, we can just touch on the surface.
We can talk about foundational issues.
We can establish some common language.
We can introduce definitions and concepts for those fields.
But ultimately, it's up to you to follow those fields
in their exciting directions.
Quantum degenerate gases and quantum computation
really changed atomic physics.
They became the dominant topics at all major conferences
in the '90s.
And that has actually, to some extent, remained.
The reasons are that those fields have rapidly developed,
and have shown advances and breakthroughs which
could not be anticipated.
So at the end of this course, we are right there in the present,
right there where major developments take place.
I hope you enjoy this module.
And I hope you enjoyed this course.
