Any questions?
Yes.
So if we were to look beyond the dipole approximation,
would we see transitions that [INAUDIBLE] same state?

Yes or no.
What we need here is a bilinear interaction,
which has a raising lowering operation for the atom.
And here it has a raising and lowering atom
operator for the photon number.
And it has the co-rotating term, where you raise here
and you lower there.
You lower here and you raise there.
But there are also terms where you
raise the atomic excitation, and you raise the photon number
by 1, which, of course, violates energy.
But the message I want to give you
is, this is possible for short times.
And this is exactly what the quantum mechanical equations
tell us.
So the short answer to your question
is, as long as we describe the system
by the dipole interaction, all what we have, even beyond--
I'm not using a perturbative argument.
I'm writing down the operator.
And this operator can now affect this system
to all possible orders.
So even the non-perturbative strong coupling limit
will always have products of atomic raising operators,
lowering operators with photon raising and lowering operators.

The little bit longer answer is, some of what I'm telling you
may be gauge dependent.
If you if you use not the dipole description, but you use the p
dot a Hamiltonian, this Hamiltonian
has the a squared term.
The a squared term allows the atoms to exchange
two photons at the same time.
So in other words, in the a squared interaction,
we may have a vertex point in time
where the atom interacts with the photon field
where two photons are exchanged.
And then the rules are different.
So in that sense--
but this is quite often, when we give a quantum
mechanical picture which has terms which nicely show
the time evolution, and you think, wow, yeah,
this is what happens.
One photon at a time, the atom goes ground excited, excited
ground state.
And you have your picture.
And it is fully consistent with the exact quantum
mechanical result.
You may be able to get the same result out
of a different picture.

That point will actually occur again
when we talk, for instance, about density operators.
The density operator is an average over quantum states.
But you can get the same density operator
by averaging quantum states in different basis set.
So if you get one picture out of one specific basis set.
It gives you the correct intuition.
It's a correct description, but it is not
the only possible description.
Colin.
Maybe the thing-- maybe what you're tyring to get at
is that picture works as long as you can limit yourself
to a two-level system.
That's correct to all orders of strong coupling.
But as long as you can identify the two-level system, where
I think the dipole versus quadrupole approximation
[INAUDIBLE], say, in an atom may have
transition probabilities to others, like from an s
to a d state.
But--
Actually, I was just wondering if it was possibly
to have a transition matrix element where
you could couple, like, the ground state to the ground
state.
Yes, the a square operator does that.
Because in the other gauge, which is pa,
p is the momentum operator for the atoms.
And the p operator will switch the atom from ground
to excited state.
A, the vector potential, involves a and a dagger.
So the p dot a term does pretty much the same
as the d dot e term, because it's
a bilinear product of an operator which
has an effect on the atoms, and has an effect on the photons.
And it means you always switch the quantum state and your atom
and create or annihilate a photon.
But the a squared term is just a squared--
it doesn't have a p in front of it--
will allow an atom in without changing the state to create
two photons, emit two photons.
And then there's probably a cross term,
which means to absorb and emit a photon.
You will actually, in one of your next homework assignments,
you will actually look at the square term.
And I think it's a very educational problem.
So you'll really see that you have
two very different descriptions, but the results fully agree.
But this is already an expert discussion.
Why don't we, for now, just hang onto the dipole approximation.
We have d dot e, and we just learn
what is inside the dipole approximation
and what is an exact quantum mechanical description using
the dipole approximation.
And then we can come back to the discussion,
is everything we describe really real?
And the answer is, what is real in quantum physics
is the final result. The intermediate results,
you have to say that this is only one possibility
