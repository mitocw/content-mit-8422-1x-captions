So the question is, now we understand the stick diagram
of the mollow triplet that we have always
aligned at the carrier.
Actually, let me put--
let me just put marks here.
We have the carrier and the resonance frequency.
But the question is now, what is the width of the spectrum?

The general answer is rather difficult,
but let me give it to you.
And I will derive it from the optical Bloch equation.
Let me discuss that one limit where the detuning is
larger than anything else.
And the other case is the resonant case.
In general, we started out by saying
that we have a delta function at low intensity.
If you now go to higher and higher intensity,
you still sort of have the delta function
from the lowest order diagram.
But the higher order diagram become more important.
And the spectrum is, in general, a superposition of three
[? broaden ?] peaks in the data function.
At low intensity, you only have the delta function.
At high intensity, the weight of the elastic scattering,
the delta function, goes to 0.
And now let's discuss the widths.
And that shows you that even light
scattering by a two-level system, those very, very
simple Jaynes-Cummings Model, has interesting,
and maybe non-intuitive aspect.
The side bends have a width of gamma.
The carrier has a width of 2 gamma.
But when you are on resonance, the situation changes.
The carrier has now a width of gamma,
and the side bends have a width of 3/2 gamma.
But if you look at it, the sum of the three widths
is always 4 gamma.
