The reason why I want to show it to you
diagrammatically are actually twofold.
One is, it's really beautiful how it comes out.
But the second thing is--
when I introduce the Feynman diagrams
and all this formulation in terms of propagators--
I gave you a wonderful picture, but in the end,
I reduced it to first and second order perturbation theory.
So I want to show you at least one non-trivial example, where
you would not get the result easily without this formalism.
So enjoy one non-trivial application of diagrams.
So if we follow the systematic way
how we have set up our formulation of [INAUDIBLE]
electrodynamic with the quantized photon field,
then the true neutral atoms have no direct coulomb interaction.
I just want to point that out, because a few minutes ago,
when I said a classical system is just coulomb field.
Each charge element has a coulomb potential
with the other charge element.
This was just the opposite of [INAUDIBLE].
But in our QED formulation, we have sold our soul.
We have said, we only regard the near-field,
the longitudinal field as belonging to the atoms.
Everything which happens at longer range
is included in our atom-photon Hamiltonian.
So therefore, there is no direct coulomb interaction
for the longitudinal field.
Everything now has to come from the interaction,
the perturbation operator, for the quantized radiation field.
And therefore, we must get it out.
We have one atom at d, one at d prime.
I'm using now the nomenclature which
is used in atom-photon interaction, pages 121 to 126.
And so there is one atom at the unprimed location, one atom
at the primed location.
And everything has to come out now
of the formulation of the quantized radiation field.
And we have discussed at length that
the transverse electric field become operators a plus a dega.
The symbol for the dipoles are operators acting on the atoms.
We've done all that.
So then the only thing which happens is--
and this is described by a and a dega--
is the exchange of photons.
So the only way how those two neutral objects can interact
is through the radiation field.
And through the radiation field means
they have to emit photons.
So I want to show you now that the Van der Waals
interaction can be thought of as one atom emitting a photon.
But this virtual photon is absorbed by the other atom
and vice versa.

And you may have heard quite often--
but I'm not sure if you've seen it explicitly--
that a lot of interactions in physics
are actually mediated by the exchange of virtual particles.
The famous example is that the nuclear force
comes from a virtual exchange of pions.

But then people say the coulomb force
comes from a virtual exchange of photons.
But usually, we don't really show you
how this virtual exchange of photons works.
So in that sense, I'm proud that I can show you
at least the basic outline of how virtual exchange of photons
between two neutral atoms leads to the Van der Waals potential.
So that's our agenda.

Now, the fact that this takes six pages in the book
and the book is not solving all equations
means if you really want to do it quantitatively,
it has a certain complexity.
But what I've done is I've distilled out
the [INAUDIBLE] idea, which also shows
you what happens when you go from short-range to long-range.
And this is what I want to present you.
And therefore, I take Benjie's question.
And we'll not discuss all the modes
of the electromagnetic field.
I will immediately use the fact that the dominant contribution
comes from modes.
And since we don't have real photons--
we don't have energy to create real photons when everything is
in the ground state--
we call them virtual photons.
Virtual photos are photons which are emitted,
but a short time later-- because of Heisenberg's uncertainty--
have to disappear.
So the dominant contributions come from virtual photons
at the wavelengths which is d, the distance between atoms.
So the frequency, which will play an important role,
is simply the frequency of those virtual photons.
And I gave you already the reason,
the density of states which favor higher frequencies,
but higher frequencies cancel because
of the e to the ikr terms.
So we only focus on those.
The second thing I need is that, when we do perturbation theory,
the energy shift in perturbation theory--
well, if you do second order, you go from the initial state
to an intermediate state.
And then you go from the intermediate state one
to the final state.
And what you have to do is you have to divide by the energy
denominator.
If you do higher and higher order perturbation theory,
in our diagramatic presentation, that
means we have propagators at intermediate energies.
And I told you that the time an atom can
spend in the immediate state is 1 over the energy defect.

So if you integrate the e to the i energy defect factor
over time, you get something which is proportional to 1
over delta e.
So therefore, if you perform the time integration
of the perturbation analysis, you
find, by integrating over the short time,
particles spent in the intermediate state,
you actually generate those energy denominators.
That's actually the relationship between the time propagation
I showed you earlier.
And when you integrate over the time,
you get for this intermediate state contribution,
which is 1 over the energy defect
over the intermediate state.
So therefore, if you go now to a higher order perturbation
theory, we simply have a product of matrix elements
in the numerator.
And in the denominator, we have a product of energy defects.
We are using that all the time for second-order perturbation
theory.
But the structure is that you can just
daisy chain the expression and you
get higher-order perturbation theory.
So therefore, all we will have to understand
to figure out what happens when virtual photons are exchanged--
I will just show you two relevant diagrams.
And look, we stare at the diagrams.
And figure out, what are these denominators?
What are those energy defects?
And we will find that there is a difference
at long-range and short-range.
So that's the agenda.
So we will need two energies.
One energy is the energy of the virtual photon,
which is exchanged.
And the second energy or frequency
is the resonant frequency of the atom.
So let's look at two relevant diagrams.
So one is atom a, one is atom b.
We are interested in interactions between atoms
in the ground state.
And after a sufficiently long time,
both atoms have to be back in the ground state.
One, two, three, four.
The result is obtained in fourth-order perturbation
theory.
It has to be fourth-order, because we need photon
exchange to emit a photon here.
Absorb it here is second order.

But then one atom is in the excited state.
And this can't be.
So a second photon is required to undo the effect.
So we need exchange of photon pairs.
Each exchange means absorption and emission.
That means two vertices and photon pairs means another two.
So we need fourth-order perturbation theory.
But it's much, much easier than you think.
So we have a ground state atom.
And now the action starts.
This is the first vertex.
It emits a photon.
The photon is absorbed by the other atom, which puts the atom
into the excited state.
This atom is also in the excited state, of course.
And then we know the atom cannot stay in the excited state
for a long time.
It can now emit a second photon, which brings it back
to the ground state.
And the second photon is absorbed by atom b
and puts the atom back into the ground state.
So this is one relevant diagram.
And let me analyze it in the energy defects.
Here, in the first intermediate step,
the energy defect is, well, we have ground, ground.
This is our reference.
But now we have put one atom into the excited state,
that costs energy omega 0.
And we have created one photon omega.
Here in that timestep, they are no photons,
but there are two excited atoms.
And in the third timestep, we have still one atom
in the excited state and one photon.
Now, this is one relevant class.
I mean, you can now use permutations
that atom b excites photons first and such.
But the structure of many of these diagrams
will be the same, that we have those three energy defects.
But now we have another possibility.
And this is, one atom emits a photon.

It doesn't want to be excited, because the excitation
energy is so precious.
It wants to immediately return to the ground state.
So we could have a situation that that atom
fires a second photon before the first photon is absorbed.

The relevant diagram is now this.
So the atom started in the ground state,
is in the excited state.
But as soon as possible, it goes back to the ground state.
And the other atom starts out in ground state,
is in the excited state, and is back in the ground state.
So what we have here is we have, again,
three intermediate steps.
In the first step, of course we have an excited atom
and a photon.
And we have the same here.
But now, the difference is that in the intermediate step,
our energy defect is not two atomic excitations.
It is two photonic excitations.
And now we want to compare those two diagrams
for short and for long-range.
And it becomes clear that short range is where
the frequency of the photon--
its wavelength is lambda.
Short-range means high frequency.
The frequency of the photon is larger
than the atomic excitation energy.
Or that means the distance is smaller
than the resonant wavelengths of the photon.
Whereas long-range is that the atomic excitation
is more precious than the photonic excitation.
So we are here in the limit that omega is larger than omega 0.
So that means if we take now the product of the free energy
denominators, omega dominates over omega 0.
So it will have the structure omega, omega 0, omega.
Omega, omega 0, omega.

Whereas, at long range, omega 0 dominates.
We have omega 0, omega 0, omega 0.
So the structure of the product of energy denominators
is one over omega 0.
If you look on the right-hand side,
we have replaced in the intermediate part
in the propagator, the energy defect by omega 0 by omega.
So therefore, in this case, we have 1 over omega cubed
and one over omega 0 squared omega.
So we know that when we sum up over diagrams,
we have to sum up over all possible diagrams.
And the ones which dominate at short-range are those ones.
And at long range are the other ones.
So in other words, at short range,
one photon is exchanged and disappears.
And then the next photon comes.
But at long range, we have an exchange
that one atom sends out two photons almost simultaneously
and the other atom absorbs them.
Because it sends them out simultaneously,
because here, we are talking about long wavelengths photons.
And photons are cheaper--
rather send out two photons before you spend too much time
in the excited state.
OK, let's wrap it up.
Since omega is proportional to 1 over the wavelengths.
And I said, the photons we are concentrating
is the photons which have a wavelengths of the distance, d.
So what we are realizing now is that if you just
compare those diagrams, at long range,
we go from 1 over omega squared to 1 over omega.
So at long range, we have an additional factor
of omega, which is 1 over d.

I can't show you that without solving the real problem--
but if you assume that, at short range,
we have 1 over r to the 6 Van der Waals potential, then
at least I've proven to you that, at long range,
you get one more power in the distance.
And this is the transition from an instantaneous potential,
where propagation effects do not matter, to what
is called a retarded potential.

So that's all I wanted to show you about interactions
between two neutral atoms.
Are there any questions?
[INAUDIBLE]
Does it matter the direction of the photons?
For example, can atom a emits to b.
B absorbs it.
B emits to a.
Rather than--
In practice, it matters.
When you solve it, you have to sum over all possibilities.
Remember, quantum mechanic [INAUDIBLE] does everything.
It doesn't care whether it's allowed or not.
It tries everything out, whether it violates energy or not.
And you have to sum over everything.
But if you then analyze all the possible diagrams,
you will actually figure out that no matter what you do--
what permutation of photons and atoms you have--
the fourth-order diagrams will be such
that they are always distinguished
by this intermediate zone.
Whether you have two atomic excitations or two photonic
excitations.
And so what I drew for you were the two diagrams
which are representative for a whole class of diagrams here.
But absolutely, yes.
