Like with every exact result, you
have to ask what it's used for because we have,
we started out with u, which we couldn't calculate with Fourier
transform.
We got G, which we couldn't calculate.
And now, we've expressed G in r, which of course we cannot
calculate exactly.
But there is an importance.
We have made progress for the following reasons.
Namely, the first is that those resonant terms, which
appears in the time evolution whenever the system goes back
to the state b, is now fully accounted for.
We've sort of factored those terms out.
We've given them special treatment.
And therefore, and this is the main result, the expression,
which now is the non-trivial expression, the function
r, the kernel, has no divergencies.
And therefore, because there is no critical part to it,
rather simple approximations can be made
and lead to physically meaningful results.
I mean that's an idea you may see often in physics.
You have a theory where there is something complicated,
non-perturbative divergence.
But you just rewrite the theory, transform the equations
in such a way that the structure of the equations
now accounts for the physics behind it.
And the part, which has to be calculated now,
can be calculated with good approximation.
And you still get the correct physics out of it.
The structure of the equation accounts for the physics.
And the numerical part has become very harmless.
But what it does is even if you do now a lowest order
approximation to the function r, even
those very simple approximation correspond
to an infinite number of terms in the original expansion.
Or in other words, the message is you have an expression.
And if you do a perturbative expansion,
well maybe you should do some form of perturbative expansion
not to the whole expression.
You should do it to some denominator
or to some part of the denominator
because then the perturbative expansion
involves no divergent terms and can be performed.
So therefore, we are now in a position
to make approximations to the function r.
And the simplest approximation which we can do
is we can just try to see if we can get away
with very low order.
It's not-- we are not getting into any divergences here.
And let me call this now the triangle.
So the circle was the naked interaction.
The square would be the exact function
if you sum up those interactions to all orders.
And the triangle is now well the step in between.
We hope to get away with the triangle.
So that would mean the following that the exact formulation
had it propagated the state b has
to go through multiple squares.
This is how it propagates.
This would be the exact result after the re-summation
we have done.
And an approximate result is now that the squares
are replaced by triangles.
So that's pretty neat.
But the importance comes now when I pull things together.
I want to show you what we have exactly
done for treating an atom in the excited state
and for treating light scattering.
So in other words, that's our result. We have derived it.
I just go now and apply to an excited atomic state.
So the state we are interested is the atomic state
b and no photons.
And the property of the atomic state
is obtained when we know the function Gb of c.
Just to tell you what it means, this
is the time evolution operator when we Fourier transform--
an inverse Laplace Fourier or Laplace transform,
which is a contour integral in the complex plane,
a generalization of the Fourier transform.
This would take us then to the time evolution
for the atom in state b.
So this is now the diagonal matrix element of the T matrix.

And this is the matrix element between state b0 b0
and the time evolution operator.
So we are calculating, of course,
the Fourier transform of the time evolution of the state
b by the Fourier transform for the resolvent G.
And all the work we have done with our diagrams
means instead of calculating G, we are calculating the kernel
r of z.
