You can immediately read off the matrix elements.
Since the intensity from this golden rule
is the matrix element squared, we
find immediately that the upper lower sideband in the carrier
involve terms cosine to the fourth theta,
sine to the fourth theta, cosine square, sine square.
We got the matrix element.
The only thing we have to know now is that the beats--
no, the rate is given by the matrix element.
But the intensity, by the-- sorry.
The radius given by the matrix element square.
But now, what is the intensity of the line?
Well, the upper sideband is emitted
by the upper dressed state because you
have to go from the upper dressed state
to the lower dressed state to get the blue detuned photon.
Therefore the intensity for the sideband
is this rate times the population
in the upper dressed test.
So what is missing at this point--
and we need it urgently for next week--
what is the population in the upper and the lower sideband?

We know the trasition rates between the upper
and lower dressed state.
We know we have just found the rate.
What is the rate?
What is the matrix element squared when you go from,
one is the upper, two is the lower state of the manifold,
so we have just gotten those rates.
And the rate equation says the change of population
in the upper dressed state is given
by the departure from the upper state
and what arrives from the lowest state.
Since we are interested in the steady state solution,
we can just set the left side to 0,
and then the rate equations simply
give us the population in terms of the rates.
In other words, if you ask, what is this steady state
solution in the upper or lower dressed state,
it's given by the ratio of those rate coefficients.
But we just got those rate coefficients,
and this gives us another bunch of sine and cosine functions.
In other words, we know now what is the population
of the dressed state.
Everything is expressed by one non-trivial parameter, theta,
and all we get is sine squared cosine squared sine
to the fourth.
We just get those trigonometric functions.
