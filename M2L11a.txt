- We have been talking about interactions
between neutral atoms.
And, that can be trivial and very profound.
Trivial because, you've heard about Von der
Walls forces, polarization forces between neutral atoms.
And, if you describe them phenomenologically,
you just have 1 over r to the 6th, or whatever power
law of an interaction.
On the other hand, if you take the position
that everything which happens between neutral objects
has to be mediated, has to be created by the photon field.
Then, it becomes a question of the vacuum,
the vacuum which surrounds the two neutral atoms.
And I've tried, in this chapter, to show you both sides.
To show similar, or the same, physics from two
different perspectives.
We talked mainly about the Von der Waals interaction
between two neutral atoms.
I don't want to--
we pretty much finished it.
So, I'll just give you a bird's eye view,
I won't really repeat a lot of things.
Because today we want to talk about the forces which
happen between neutral atoms and metal plates,
and then two metal plates, which is the Casimir force.
But, just to remind you that, we showed
that the forces between neutral objects
are actually created by quantum fluctuations.
Classical objects would not create
fluctuating dipole moments, would therefore not create,
would not give rise to any force between neutral atoms.
And I showed you that there are two aspects where
quantum physics comes in--
namely, through the fluctuations,
or the zero-point motion, of the atoms as oscillators.
And, we even had a circuit model for that.
But then, I also said, that well,
assume you have two neutral atoms
and you have the vacuum fluctuations of the field.
This vacuum fluctuation is thriving,
coordinated, synchronized dipole moment between the two atoms,
and then the two atoms can attract each other.
So, we have seen the dual role which quantum physics plays
here in terms of quantum fluctuations
of the atomic oscillators.
And, quantum fluctuation of the electromagnetic field
which is another harmonic oscillator.
And, at least, when I used very simple pictures
it seemed that the 1 over r to the 6th potential,
the standard Van der Waals potential at short range,
comes from the fluctuations of the oscillator.
Where as, we, I didn't do the derivation.
But, the simplest derivation for the long range,
causing [INAUDIBLE] retarded potential 1 over r to the 7th,
focused on the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field.
So, these were some preliminaries.
Then I thought, I want to show you the power of diagrams
by showing to you that there are two
different kinds of diagrams--
dominant at short range and at long range.
And, with that, we realized diagrammatically
that because of the nature of virtual photons, which
are exchanged by the two neutral atoms,
there is a change in power law.
The power, the inverse power, of the distance
between the two neutral atoms is 1 higher at long range.
And, long range meant that it also
became clear diagrammatically.
Long range means the distance is longer than
