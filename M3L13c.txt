Before I discuss with you optical Bloch equation
and master equation in general, I
want to give you a very simple model.
I really like simple models which
capture the essence of what you want to discuss.
So I want to use a beam splitter model for photons.
I formulate it for photons, but it would also immediately
apply to atoms.
And this model, what I like about it is it
has all the ingredients of the derivation of the master
equation we do later on, without the kind of many indices
and summations and integration.
But it captures every single bit of what is important.
And I usually like to present exactly solvable simple models
where you get it, and then I can go a little bit faster
through the general derivation, because you
know exactly what the more complicated equations,
what they are doing.
In other words, what I want to derive for you is,
we want to have the following situation.
We have a beam splitter.
And we know everything about beam splitters,
because we talked about them in the first part of the course.
And we have a wave function which is the input.
And this is a photon.
And we want to understand after the beam splitter,
how has the system evolved.
In general, it will be a density matrix.
And what you want to find out is what
is the equation for the density matrix?
Maybe this density matrix goes through the next beam splitter,
and then we want to know what comes out of it.
And all we have to apply is the formalism
we developed for the beam splitter earlier in the course.
Of course, the beam splitter is not as harmless
as it looks like.
There is another port and another port.
One here brings in the environment.
And for the environment, we will use the vacuum.
That's the simplest environment.
It's actually an important environment,
because it's the environment we will use all the time when we
discuss spontaneous emission.
We send photons into Nirvana, into the vacuum,
and they disappear.
And this is our model for it.
But the other one, which is often not so explicit,
if you send your photons away, you're
not keeping track of what happens.
But you could as well perform a measurement.
And this is what we put in here.
We say those photons hit a bucket or detector.
And we measure them.
We observe them.
There's nothing else we do with them,
so we can as well measure them.
And this will immediately lead to the equation for the density
matrix.
So this is what you want to discuss.
And it will have all the ingredients later
on, in a mathematically simple form,
for the derivation of the master equation.
So let's consider a single photon for that.
So the wave function is a superposition
of no photon and one photon.
And the coefficients are alpha and beta.
And just for simplifying notation,
I pick alpha and beta to be real.
So what do we expect to happen at the beam splitter?
Well, there's a probability that the photon gets reflected--
probability to reflect the photon--
and therefore, to observe the photon.
This probability is, of course, beta square, the probability
that we have a photon to begin with.
And then the beam splitter--
remember, we characterized the beam splitter
with angle sine theta cosine theta.
Sine theta was the reflection amplitude, cosine theta
the transmission amplitude.
So this probability, which I call P1,
is the probability for reflection and for measurement.
And now, naively you would think what
happens after the system has passed through the beam
splitter?
With a probability of P1, we've measured the photon.
We know for sure there is no photon left.
The system is in the vacuum state.
But then you would say, well, maybe
with probability 1 minus P1, we have not measured anything.
Nothing has happened to the wave function.
And that means the wave function just continues.
Well, as we will see, this is wrong.
We are missing something.
What we are actually missing is that if we measure nothing,
the wave function is not psi.
The possibility that we could have measured something
changes the wave function.
I will comment on that in much more detail in a few lectures
down the road when I derive for you quantum
Monte Carlo wave function.
I will have a wonderful discussion with you
about how does a non-observation change a wave function,
so we will talk about the physics behind it
in some more detail.
Right now, I don't want to get into this discussion.
I simply want to use our beam splitter equation.
So we can just take the beam splitter equation and apply it.
So our output state is obtained by taking the operator
for our beam splitter.
And maybe you will remember that the propagation for beam
splitter was described by an operator which
had a dagger b plus b dagger a in the exponent.
a and b are the two input modes and the angle
of the beam splitter, which interpolates
between 0% and 100% reflection and transmission, is theta.
We are now looking for the output
state of the total system.
We are not performing the measurement yet.
And this is now acting on the total system, which
is the cross product of our photon system,
of our system of interest.
And the other input, which we call the environment
or the vacuum, is 0.

Look a few weeks back.
We have done that all.
The output state is--
there was a probability alpha that we
had no photon in the state psi.
And if we have no photon in state psi
and no photon in the vacuum, this
is the state 0, 0, what I denote here in second place
is the environment.
And now, we have one photon.
We have exactly one photon with the amplitude beta.
And this photon is split with cosine theta transmitted,
and with sine theta reflected.
If you transmit it, we have 1, 0.
If you reflect it, we have 0, 1.
And again, this is the environment,
and here is a photon in the environment.
So let me just be clear that this is
where the environment comes in.
It is a vacuum state.
And here, this is the output port for the environment.
This is where we do the measurement.
And I don't think it matters.
I haven't really told you which is mode a, which is mode b.
Doesn't matter, but let's say the environment is mode
b and the system evolves in mode a.
So what is our output?
Now we have two possibilities.
The environment is 0 or the environment is 1,
and we perform a measurement.
So we have to now go into a probabilistic description.
So with probability P1, we have done a measurement.
And our output state is now the vacuum state.
With probability 1 minus P1, we have not
detected anything in the vacuum.
And therefore, our state of the system
is alpha 0 plus beta cosine theta 1.

So it is not beta 1 as naively you would have assumed.
It's not the original state.
There is a cosine theta factor, which we got exactly
from the beam splitter, from the unitary evolution provided
by the beam splitter.
And since this state is no longer normalized,
I have to normalize it by alpha squared plus beta squared
cosine squared theta.
So now we have done our measurement, probability
P1 to detect the photon.
This projects the system into the vacuum state.
With a probability 1 minus P1, we have that state.
And that means that our system is now
described by a density matrix with probability P1
and 1 minus P1.
With probability P1, we are in the vacuum state.
And with probability 1 minus P1, we are in that state psi 0--
