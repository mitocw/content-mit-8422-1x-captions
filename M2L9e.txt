Now I want to discuss the nature of those intermediate states.
And maybe what you should have in mind, the intermediate state
which comes about when we have the system in the ground state,
it emits a photon and goes down to this intermediate state,
to this weird state which seems to be lower in energy
than the current state.
Well, what happens is those intermediate states when
they appear after the vertex, they
propagate with their energy.
But if their energy is less than the initial energy,
the energy in the intermediate state k
has a phase factor in its propagation, which
is determined by the difference of its energy
with the initial energy.
So when we violate energy conservation
in intermediate state, delta Ek is non-zero,
and it is larger than what violate in energy conservation.
And then in the solution of the time evolution,
we have to integrate over all intermediate times.
So what we have here is we have an oscillating phase factor.
And when we integrate it, when we integrate something
oscillating over longer than an oscillation period,
it averages out to zero.
So therefore, those intermediate states
which are off the energy shell, which seem to violate energy,
can only noticeably contribute over
a duration which is 1 over the energy defect delta Ek.

So it is correct to say that the system, in its time
evolution for short times, can, so to speak,
violate energy protected by Heisenberg's uncertainty
relation.
Or you can say the system can do whatever it wants.
It can spontaneously create 10 photons.
But this is pretty much like taking money, taking a deposit
out of Heisenberg's bank, and after a very, very short time
you have to pay it back by having
another process which brings you back to the correct energy.
I should put it under quotation marks
when I said we violate energy.
Because energy is not sort of defined or measurable
in these intermediate times.
We start the process with a quantum system,
we look at what happens afterwards,
and whenever we assess energy, it
is assessed when the final time is much, much larger
than the initial time.
And I just showed you that eventually the system
has to be back to a final energy, Ef,
which is identical to the initial time, Ei.
So in other words, I just want you to keep it in mind,
I've proven to you energy conservation in the limit
that T final minus T initial is large.
And when I'm now talking about non-conservation of energy,
I do that in quotation marks.
Because we know energy is conserved in the end.
It's just that for very, very short times in the time
evolution of the system, there appear states, virtual states,
which seem to violate energy.
But you can think about it in that way.
