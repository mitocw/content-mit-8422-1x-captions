We can now use the traced atom picture
to calculate the heating.
Remember the final temperature you can reach
was always the ratio between a heating coefficient,
which is actually the momentum diffusion coefficient,
over alpha.
So right now we have understood the alpha part.
We know the physical picture.
y alpha provides cooling why we have a friction
force for blue-detuned light.
But let's now take it to the next step
and calculate what is the heating.
And I mentioned it already in the context
of simple molasses, which we discussed two weeks ago,
that we describe heating by the momentum diffusion coefficient.
Well, the momentum diffusion coefficient
tells you that p square is simply
cooling as a function of time.
If you have a cold cloud and you heat it up,
you can describe the heating by the [INAUDIBLE] of p square.
If you don't like momentum, divide p square by 2m
and you have the kinetic energy, which increases.
So it is this momentum diffusion coefficient.
And if you have a cloud which moves with an average momentum,
you only want to have the p square minus p average square.
But if you think about a cloud which is being cooled,
the second term is [INAUDIBLE].
OK.
So the momentum diffusion coefficient
is the derivative of p square, but the derivative of p
is simply the force.
So therefore we can absorb the derivative by replacing--
at least one of the p's--
by the force.
And we can now get root of the second p
of the second occurrence of momentum
by saying, well, momentum is derivative of force--
or, sorry, derivative of momentum is force, or momentum
is the integral of force.
So we can exactly rewrite that momentum diffusion coefficient
by an integral over correlation function of forces,
and then we have the nice physical picture
that the increase of kinetic energy--
the momentum diffusion coefficient--
comes because of fluctuations of the force.
Yes?
[INAUDIBLE] previous page [INAUDIBLE].
Let's assume this is what it should be.

OK.
So here is the reminder-- the kinetic energy--
if you have a process which causes momentum diffusion,
the momentum diffusion coefficient
gives you the heating rate.
And the cooling rate is given by our friction coefficient alpha.
And as we discussed in the context of molasses--
of red-detuned molasses, but it applies to any cooling scheme--
the finite temperature is when you
have detailed balance between heating and cooling,
and therefore it's the ratio of the momentum diffusion
coefficient over the friction coefficient.
Nancy.
In the previous step, what was the significance
of choosing f of 0 basically?

The time arguments were 0 and 8.
So we said that f of 0 is [INAUDIBLE].
We assume that the laser beam's Hamiltonian
is invariant against time translation,
and we simply evaluate that at t equals 0.
So that's so often the argument.
You have fluctuating forces, and you
could have fluctuating forces at time t and time t prime.
But then you use the argument that in a steady state
solution, the correlation function does not
depend on t and t prime separately but only
on the difference.
And then you simply said one argument
to zero and the other argument becomes a time difference.
Other questions?
OK.

So now, by understanding that momentum diffusion is
nothing else than the interaction over the force
fluctuation, we can now use this physical picture
which I gave you earlier that's an atom, which cascades
through upper/lower upper/lower trace states,
will experience opposite but equal forces from the right
and from the left.
So I can simply evaluate that by assuming we are on resonance.
On resonance, the force is h over 2 times the derivative
of the generalized Rabi frequency.
And the force correlation--
what is it?
Well, it's the force f of zero times f of t.
But as long as the atom is in one trace state,
the force doesn't change.
So I simply take here the force--
I take the force squared, and then when I integrate--
when I integrate over that, well, the moment the atom
makes a transition, there is no longer
any correlation between the force.
Everything becomes random and the integral average
is out of zero.
So in other words, that's the way
you should look at this integral.
You start with the force f zero.
As long as the force is correlated,
because the atom hasn't done spontaneous emission,
you have sort of f of zero, f of zero,
and you integrate it nominally to infinity,
but you simply integrate it until some spontaneous emission
randomizes the system.
So therefore, this integral over the correlation function
is nothing else than the force squared times the typical time
scale for a transition.
So if we put that in on resonance,
we have the force here.
We square the force, and then we multiply
with the spontaneous emission rate which for a resonance
system is gamma over two.
And with that, we get now the heating coefficient--
the momentum diffusion coefficient--

for an atom, which is exposed to resonant light
and to the stimulated light force.

The paper-- the references I've given you--
is simply taking this argument and extending that
to every [INAUDIBLE] detuning.
For every [INAUDIBLE] detuning, I told you
what happens on resonance.
The atom spins equal amounts in each trace state.
If you detune, the atom spends more time
in one trace state, then quickly in the other trace state,
and then more time in the other trace state again.
So you can, by simply understanding
what are the rates for cascading between the trace levels,
you could pretty much write down the expression, find it,
and here is the solution taken out of the paper.
So we have the correct [INAUDIBLE],
but then if the detuning is non-vanishing,
we get a contribution from the second factor.
Colin.
Are you assuming exponential correlation?
Exponential behavior to the correlation [INAUDIBLE].
Because then you might have different [INAUDIBLE]
if there--
if you're in a cavity.

Well, what happens is the following.
I think if you're in one trace state,
and the force pushes you in one direction
and you integrate over it, you have an exponential decay.
But instead of integrating over the exponential decay,
you can just take the 4 squared and multiply it
with the average time the atom stays.
So you are asking--
in other words, if I have an exponentially decaying
function, I can always approximate it
by the function of t equals zero times the time.
And what you are asking me now is, is the time the one over e
time, or is it an average time?
What is the correct time to use here?
I guess wouldn't the time scale depend
on how the coefficients decay?
[INAUDIBLE] different--

Yes.
OK.
I agree.
The shape of the decay of the correlation function
would matter--
I'm not going into that--
but what I am sort of assuming here
is that the correlation function indicated with time
is the correlation function of t equals zero
times the correlation time.
And how the correlation time is related
to the exponential time, or if there a small prefect in such,
that may depend on details.
Yes.
You're right.
