I want to tell you what are the techniques to create
ultra-low temperatures.
And the techniques I want to discuss
is one addition to laser cooling.
We have, so far, discussed laser cooling to the Doppler limit.
But now, I have to tell you that that's not
where laser cooling stops.
You can go sub-Doppler and subrecoil.
And at least when the Nobel Prize was given to Bill
Phillips, Steve Chu, and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji--
well, If you go to the Nobel website
and read the report of the Nobel Committee--
well, they should have given it to those three
people for the many, many wonderful things
they have done.
And I've made frequent references to their work.
Bill Phillips invented Zeeman slower.
Claude Cohen-Tannoudji invented the pressed atom picture.
They have done many, many contributions.
But the Nobel Committee tried to justify their choice
with a coherent story.
And the coherent story was Steve Chu cooled to the Doppler limit
in molasses.
Bill Phillips discovered sub-Doppler cooling.
And Claude Cohen-Tannoudji realized sub-Recoil cooling.
So the story line was cold, colder, the coldest.
And that's what we want to talk today.

So sub-Doppler cooling-- well, 10 years ago,
I spent a whole lecture on sub-Doppler cooling,
polarization gradient cooling.
Wonderful-- the kind of epiphany of elegance
in trying to make handy the description of an atom.

And then I explained, in another lecture, sub-Recoil cooling,
how you can even cool below the recoil limit.
Well, this year, 2013, I spent 15 minutes on it.
The reason is the following.
When I joined atomic physics and was a post-doc
in the '90s and assistant professor,
the conference's theme of future of laser, future of--
it was full-on attempts to find new ways
to laser cool, ideas of how to get to lower
and lower temperatures.
Many, many different sub-Doppler,
sub-Recoil techniques were discussed.
This was the main topic.
But then, suddenly in 1995, evaporative cooling--
an intellectually boring cooling technique,
just have atoms collide and evaporate-- this led
to the lowest temperature ever.
And it was almost a sudden transition.
Within a few months, there was no research,
no papers anymore on advanced methods of laser cooling.
Evaporative cooling just completely wiped out
this area of atomic physics.
The reason being because all cooling
schemes which have been discussed had, in the end,
some problems.
At some point, photons heat, heat
because they excite an atom.
And if an excited atom collides with another atom,
there is a heating mechanism and such.
So even all the optimistic proposals for laser cooling
reached very low temperature, but never at high density.
And evaporative cooling just did everything for you.
But anyway, I think, not just because a Nobel Prize was given
for sub-Doppler and sub-Recoil cooling--
this is really an accomplishment to understand,
how can you go through conventional cooling limits?
And at least every graduate student
who happens to graduate in AMO physics at MIT
should know what are the concepts
behind sub-Doppler and sub-Recoil cooling.
So what I need, in order to introduce those cooling methods
for you, is I have to remind you that optical pumping
is a cooling scheme.
And one could actually say, to some extent, every cooling
you do with lasers is based on optical pumping.
And let me explain that.
Optical pumping happens that, let's say,
you have a level structure with a circularly polarized light,
where you can go maybe, from M equals 1 to M equals 0.
And then there can be spontaneous emission back to M
equals 1 and back to M equals minus 1.
But the laser, because it has angular momentum,
cannot excite this state to any excited state.
So what happens, of course, is pretty clear.
You have whatever distribution you have in state 1 and 2.
You switch on your laser.
And after a few cycles, everything
has fallen into the dark state.
You have 100% population in stage 2.
So this is the simplest example of optical pumping,
using a three-level scheme.
Well, you may ask now, what has that to do with cooling?
Well, temperature is the Boltzmann factor.
And if we can define a temperature by saying,
the population between two levels
is given by a Boltzmann factor--
let's just introduce an energy-splitting delta-E, which
is somewhat arbitrary here.
But in any event, you see, if you completely pump out
a level, if you have all the population
in one state, this corresponds to 0 temperature.
So if you optically pump the atoms preferentially
into certain states, you will blow out
the entropy of the system.
The atoms are no longer distributed over as many states
as before.
And this corresponds to lower temperature.
And the message I want to give you
is that you can understand laser cooling
as optical pumping in constellation speeds,
in velocity space.
When you laser cool, you excite the atoms at high velocity.
And then because of the mechanism we discussed,
spontaneous emission leads to lower velocities.
And this is one form of optical pumping.
I also like the word--
optical pumping is, in some sense,
a spontaneous Raman process.

You go up with the laser photon.
You go down with a spontaneously emitted photon.
So this is a spontaneous Raman process.
And laser cooling, even if you have just a single ground
state, can be regarded as a Raman process, where
the initial and final state differ in velocity or momentum.
You have the same internal state.
But you have a different external state.
So you can say laser cooling is spontaneous Raman scattering
between different momentum states.
