So there are two new concepts which I want to introduce.
One is the idiopathic elimination of coherencies,
and the second one is the quantum Zeno effect.
So first of all, if you look at the differential equation,
and when kappa is small, in particular, kappa
is smaller than two times a vacuum Rabi frequency,
then the population to be in the excited state, which is rho 22,
undergoes Rabi oscillation.
And those Rabi oscillations, this population,
is stemmed by e to the minus kappa t.
So what I want to discuss now is the overdamped case.
I think you know by now that I have a preference
to maybe ask you questions about really simple quantum physics.
Quantum physics is subtle enough that nobody fully
understands it.
And we want to improve on that.
So I want to test your intuition by looking at the situation.
We have an excited state without photon, we have a ground state.
So I want to test your intuition in the following way.
We have Rabi oscillations between two levels.
The case in the cavity is a Rabi oscillation
between state two and state one, but it doesn't matter.
You can also assume that it is a Rabi oscillation between two
hyperfine levels and the Rabi oscillation
is driven by an RF field.
And the one thing we introduce now
is we introduce damping kappa to this level.
But we start out the system with all the population
in this state.
And in the overdamped case, when kappa is sufficiently strong,
an oscillator will be overdamped and will no longer oscillate.
And in this situation, the probability
to be in the initial state will decay, e to the minus gamma t.
So it decays with a decay rate kappa.
