Let me just first show you, I want
to mix in theory and experiment, how sound can be observed.
I should actually say, this experiment is sort of dear
to my heart, because at some point
it clicked to me, how the new world of atomic physics
connects with condensed matter physics.
Soon after we had realized Bose-Einstein condensates,
a famous condensed matter theorist said,
hey Wolfgang, you should now observe sound.
Sound is important, yeah OK, but how do you observe sound.
Use a piazzo and just kick the system and create a sound wave.
And I said, oh gosh, this guy doesn't
know that if you put anything in contact with the quantum
gas as a piazzo the gases will just stick to it.
He has no idea what our system is.
But then I said, wait a moment we have to translate.
He says use a piazzo.
Well, I have to translate.
In atomic physics, how do we kick atoms? with a laser beam.
And in that moment, I had the idea
that we can take a Bose-Einstein condensate,
suddenly switch on a [INAUDIBLE] tuned propulsive laser beam,
this will do exactly as a piazzo,
create a density perturbation and then
the density perturbation will propagate
with the speed of sound.
And that worked.
That was just when Bose-Einstein condensations were very fresh.
One of the first scientific experiments
done, we switch on the laser and you
see color-coded in red the density perturbation which
propagates outward.
And the slope of this line is the speed of sound.
And here we determine the speed of sound
