Now how do we define eta?
How do we select the energy threshold for evaporation?
Well, for many, many years Bose-Einstein condensation
was mainly done in magnetic traps.
And there are two methods.
One is just lower the magnetic fields.
But lowering the magnetic field is pretty bad,
because it weakens the magnetic trap.
And if you weaken the trap, you lower the density.
And therefore, just because of that, the elastic collision
rate slows down.
So what turned out to be by far the superior choice
is to remove atoms with if induced evaporation.
So if you're a magnetic trap, you can tune
and our f spin flip transition to a certain frequency.
But the frequency depends on magnetic field,
the magnetic field in a trap depends on position.
So what you are doing is you are selecting with your eye,
a frequency, a certain point in space
where the atoms can leave the trap
and are transferred by a spin flip if transition
to an n-type trapped state.
And are then rejected from the trap.
I mean this is very flexible.
You can change the depths of your magnetic trap
by just using an f synthesizer.
And you can change the trap depths,
you can lower the trap debts without weakening
the confinement potential.
I don't have time to go into details,
but what I'm showing here is that there is one
that the two regimes, when you have this magnetic trap
or have this spin up, or we spin down
and this is your if transition.
There is a regime where you have stronger RF,
you should now use dressed energy levels.
We've discussed dressed energy levels in the optical domain.
These are now dressed energy levels in the RF domain.
And there's a wonderful chapter about it
in atom photon interaction.
So it really means in the dressed energy levels
become something like this.
So you have a potential, which looks like an inverted w
and you really realize this potential.
But when the RF is weak, you have only a certain probability
where the atoms go back and forth through the transition
region that sometimes it will fall down to the lower state.
And this looks more like this.
The diabetic picture looks more like
that you have a little leak and the atoms
are trickling down to the non confining state.
Anyway, there are two regimes and the experiment
is usually somewhere in between.
It is not necessary to go to the fully adiabatic.
It doesn't pay off to go to the fully adiabatic limit.
So this is how RF evaporation is implemented.
But I should say, in these days, a lot of evaporation
is now done in optical traps.
And in optical traps, the method of choice
is you just ramp down the optical trapping potential.
Now when you ramp down the optical trapping potential,
addressing Collin's question, you usually
do not go into the runaway regime
because I haven't included that my model assumed
we have a constant trap.
But if you now add to the model that you are continuously
opening up, weakening the trap, you
have another effect which makes the exponent
for runaway evaporation more negative.
And I think ultimately you don't get any runaway evaporation
anymore.
On the other hand, optical traps are often more tightly
confining than magnetic traps.
And you have sufficiently high density to begin with.
So therefore, you can tolerate a slowdown of evaporation
and still reach the destination.
But anyway, we are now getting more and more
into the technical aspects.
I think I've given you the concepts.
But let me just flesh you one picture.
This, of course, assumes an idealized model
where we have only two levels spin up and spin down.
You all know that atoms have hyperfine structure.
Sodium rubidium has n equals 2.
And if you draw now the dress levels
for five hyperfine levels in RF transition,
it looks fairly complicated.
But the result is fairly beautiful.
When an atom in f equals 2 reaches this point.
And in the dressed atom picture, the point of evaporation,
the point where the atom is in resonance with the RF
it's the point where this potential bends down.
The atom is adiabatically transferred in a tri-state
from mf plus 2 to mf minus 2.
So when you evaporate at this point,
without maybe you noticing it, you actually
do a four photon transition in the dressed atom picture.
Again, it's an example where when
we teach about these schemes we can completely neglect
about hyperfine structure.
And it's just wonderful that the actual implementation
works as well for complicated atoms
than it does for our idealized two-level atom.
