Let me now simply describe to you how
the magneto-optic trap works.

Let me describe it for an atom which actually doesn't, which
an atom which we are not using in the lab.
We usually use atoms with a hyperfine structure,
but let me just, for pedagogical simplicity,
assume that we have an atom which has an s to p transition.
And in the p transition, we have the three different magnetic
quantum numbers.
So it's a simplified model.
And what we are doing right now is we are applying molasses.
Two beams which act as molasses.
But there is one difference now.
They have different polarization.
Sigma plus and sigma minus.
And in addition, we apply a linear magnetic field gradient.
So what happens now is the following.
The linear magnetic field gradient
does Zeeman shifts in the opposite direction
to the m plus 1 and m minus 1 level.
Now the transition to m minus 1 is done by sigma plus light.
The transition to m plus 1 is done by sigma minus light.
So what happens now is if you have an atom,
and it moves away from the origin,
it will eventually come closer and closer in resonance
with the sigma plus light.
But the sigma plus light comes from the left side,
so the atom will be pushed back.
If the atom moves out here, it moves further and further away
in resonance from the sigma plus light,
but it moves now in resonance with the sigma minus light,
and the sigma minus light is pushing the atoms back.
So this geometry has an inward force from both directions,
and therefore works as a trap.
So let me now describe it mathematically,
which is very, very simple.
What we have to do is we just have like in molasses,
have two laser beams.
Two times the expression for the spontaneous light
force, and you'll remember we got the molasses equation
by taking the two laser beams, and putting
in the Doppler shift, which is a velocity-dependent shift.
Well, all we have to do is for those two laser beams,
we have to put now a spatially-dependent Zeeman
shift, which varies linearly with position.
So therefore all we have to do is we sum up the total force
as a spontaneous force for the right
and for the left laser beam.
And in addition to the molasses effect,
we put now in the spatial dependence.
So we don't have to do the math again.
We did already a Taylor expansion in v,
but let's now just do a Taylor expansion
in the [? blue ?] expression.
And then we find that there is a linearly restoring force,
both in velocity space and in configuration space.

Which actually tells you something interesting.
The more friction you have, the larger is the restoring force.
So the trapping and the cooling are really connected,
at least in this simple model of the spontaneous light force.
So if you have this kind of force,
a linear force in velocity, a linear force in position,
this is the equation of motion of a damped harmonic
oscillator.
We have a spatial force constant, k, linear force,
which is linear in displacement.
So this is a damped harmonic oscillator.
Usually, you don't see atoms sloshing
in your magneto-optic trap like in an harmonic
oscillator, because if you look through the [? typical ?]
numbers, and by just doing the Taylor
expansion of the spontaneous light force,
you can immediately get analytic expressions for those numbers.
In almost all cases, the harmonic oscillator
is overdamped.

So that's how the magneto-optic trap works.
