Let's start to discuss ion traps.
Now in many situations, ions are just charged neutral atoms.
And if the charge doesn't matter,
you can do very similar physics with ions and neutral atoms.
However, the charge makes major differences
when it comes to confining and manipulating particles.
So when I compare neutrals to ions,
the forces which we exert on neutral atoms
are magnetic forces, optical forces.
And typically, the traps we can create
have a DEPs of about 1 Kelvin.
Actually, you just need superconducting magnets.
The magnetic traps we build here at MIT have millikelvin DEPs.
So the trap DEPs is often on the order
of microkelvin, millikelvin, and Kelvin at the high scale.
Well, this is very different in ions.
In ions, you have the Coulomb force.
If you take electric fields of a hundred volts per millimeter,
you can create confinement forces for 10,000 Kelvin.
So you have no problem in confining room temperature
ions.

So this is trapping and confinement.
If you talk about cooling, well, our [INAUDIBLE] [? causes ?]
are Doppler cooling and evaporative cooling.
You can actually cool ions by evaporation.
You can also cool ions by evaporative cooling.
But what has been very common is special to ions
is the ability to resolve sidebands, sidebands
of the vibration and motion in the harmonic oscillator trap.
And in problem set number 10, you
have looked for the physics of sideband cooling.
However, sideband cooling is now also coming back
to neutral atoms.
For instance, if you have neutral atoms in a very tightly
confining dipole trap, you can resolve sidebands
and use those for cooling.
OK what is the science?
Well, a driving force for both ions and neutral atoms
has been clocks.
If atoms are cold, you can use them
to have very accurate ways of keeping time.
And I think currently there is a race
between the best neutral atom, atomic clocks, neutral
[INAUDIBLE], optical lattices, and ion traps,
in particular, the aluminum ion at [? epola. ?]
So we have clocks in ions.
And this is what I want to talk a little bit more about today.
A major driving force quantum information.
You have two ions and get quantum gates between them.
Or you eight ions and can have now
8 qubits in an prototypical quantum computer.
So quantum information science and quantum algorithms
was quite important.
But I would say some of the physics
is at least discussed and partially pursued with atoms
and optical lattices.
And we have talked a lot about, for neutral atoms,
about quantum simulations, studying superfluidities,
studying face transitions, magnetic properties
of many body systems.
But there's now more efforts to do that with ions.
[INAUDIBLE] in Maryland is studying
antiferromagnetic ordering of a spin chain.
And the spin chain consists of a string of ions in an ion trap.
So see, actually, on the science side,
that all three clocks' precision measurements, quantum
information cubits, quantum algorhythms, and quantum
simulation of many body systems are
done with both neutral atoms and ions.
So these are now two very different platforms.
