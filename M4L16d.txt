You know, from any harmonic oscillator,
when it comes to the absorbed power,
that it's only the in quadrature component
which absorbs the power.
And you can immediately see that, when we say--
just use what is written in black now.
The energy is nothing else than the charge
times the displacement.
When we divide by delta t, you find that the absorbed power
is the electric field times the derivative
of the dipole moment.
Well, if we ever reach over one cycle,
we are only interested in d dot, which
oscillates with cosine omega t.
But that means, since it's d dot,
d oscillates with sine omega t.
And this was the in quadrature component v.
So it is only the part v of the optical Bloch vector which
is responsible for exchanging energy
with electromagnetic field.
And we can also, by dividing by the laser freq--
by the energy of a photon, find out
what is the number of absorbed photons.
But we did that already, when we discussed optical Bloch
equations.
OK, so that was our look back on the optical Bloch equation,
