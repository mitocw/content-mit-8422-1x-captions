What I want to talk more today about, if traps or power traps,
because they are used in the majority of experiments,
and they are used in pretty much all experiments
on quantum information processing with ion.
So the neat thing, and you know I
try to teach you concepts in physics, the interesting thing
about power traps, RF traps is, that you alternate
at a radio frequency between confinement
and anti-confinement.
You can say you have a settled point potential, which
is confining in x and anti-confining in y,
but then you switch x and y.
So therefore the situation is just imagine you're an ion
and you feel, half of the time a confining harmonic oscillator,
and half of the time an anti-confining harmonic
oscillator.
The question I have for you, and this is a general physics
question, well, is the sum of it confining
and an anti-confining potential of the same strengths,
does it give zero, or does it give you something
which in the end is confining?

So if you were in a potential, and the potential switches
permanently from parabolic upward to parabolic
downward, at any given position the average force
is zero, because in one phase you are forced to the left,
in the other case you have the opposite view of the same force
but with a right with the opposite sign.

What's going on here?
Yes.
So, I can't answer this mathematically or physically,
but I just remember this very cool example
that someone showed me once where they
took a saddle shape in space.
Put a ball in the middle and you spin the saddle,
and as soon as the ball tries to fall to one side
that saddle will spin over and pick it up.
So, I know has to be it is in confinement.
But I can't answer mathematically.
OK.
Colin.
There could possibly be a threshold.
Because if you consider spinning it
so slowly that the particle can just sort of roll off,
maybe there's a threshold.
Yeah, there is a threshold.
I mean, if there's a confining potentially
for a long, long time, and there's
an anti-confining potential, and I just
fall down the anti-confining potential
and I disappeared to infinity.
The confining part doesn't help me.
So there will definitely be a threshold in time
we have to switch between confining and anti-confining
sufficiently, replicate Yes.
Does it have something to do with the fictitious force
[INAUDIBLE]?
No.
But, this would have been a possibility.
Maybe there is a formalism, but the standard formalism
does not use a rotating frame.
Maybe you could think of the classical analogue,
where you have a bead on a wire, and you have to stable position
at a finite angle only at certain frequencies.
Yes
Set by--
I'm not sure.
Anyway you all, I think everybody works,
or at least has worked with optics
or knows what optics is, so why don't I discuss the following.
If you take a positive lens, and negative lens
with equal strengths, what happens now to your laser beam?
You sending a laser beam through.
It gets an inward force by the--
inward bend by the convex lens, an outward
bend by the concave lens.
Is the net effect nothing or is it focusing?

Well, it depends.
What happens is the following, if the lenses
are put in close proximity the two bending actions on the rays
just completely cancel.
But now we can do the following.
We can put the two lenses further apart,
and now the following happens.
We have a laser beam which is bent inward.
And you probably all know the lens maker's equation,
that the further out the rays are
the more they have to be bent inward to come to a focus.
So what happens is those beams are now bent inward,
but when they reach the other lanes they are now bent
outward somewhat.
I'm not very accurate in my drawing,
but the angle which they are bent inward,
is proportional to the separation here.
And the angle by which they're bent
outward is a proportional to the separation there.
So they inward bend is stronger than the outward bend.
So therefore, what I'm telling you
is convex and concave, with a certain distance
between the two results in focusing.

Now maybe you can just think about it,
what happens if I reverse convex and concave.
Is it now still focusing or is it the opposite of the example
of the example above?
Now, the first lens bends the beam outward.

Yes?
And the second lens bends it inward.
But since we've reached the second lens further out,
the inward kick is stronger than the outward bend initially.
So therefore, when you have positive and negative lenses
of equal strengths, no matter in what order you apply it,
you always get an inward force.

So this should actually explain
As long as they're in the focal length, right?
Can you imagine if you had a positive and a negative
and it's larger than a focal length away?
Yes.
Everything within reason here.
There will be a stability dial code,
but I want to first make it very plausible what happens.
And just to address the question which I raised before,
if I'm in a potential and I get an equal amount
of inward and outward force, shouldn't it average to zero?
The question is how you average.
if I would keep the distance from the x-- from the x
is constant I would say, here is a function of, let me call it
x, the bending angle is a function of x is positive.
The bending angle at the same x is negative.
So if I were to do the average at constant x I would get 0.
But what I do is, I do the average following
the trajectory of the beam.
So in other words, if I'm sitting
on this potential, which switches from attractive
to repulsive, if I would be here at my position,
the average force is 0.
But when the potential is repulsive, in one half cycle
I'm pushed outwards, and further out the attractive force is now
stronger than it was before.
And therefore, if you ever reach with the force at my position
you will always find an inward force.
But if you ever reach the force at a fixed location
it averages out to 0.

So this is exactly how RF ion traps work.
And, well, the rest are just equations to describe that.
So I think we have to make a choice.
I could derive for you the equations, how
you average over the rapid oscillations of the potential,
and you get a harmonic oscillator potential,
and this is how you trap ions.
But it's pretty much showing to you,
how the concept I've just explained to you how
it is reflected in equations.
Or the second option we have that takes about 20 minutes
is to explain to you how quantum computing is
done with two ions.
In particular how the famous Zoller-Cirac gate works.
Do you have a clear preference?
OK.
Fine.
But there's one piece of mathematics
you should understand.
Really.
And this is the only essence of the mathematical derivation.
If I'm standing here and I feel the alternating force,
it's a cosine omega t and it averages to 0.
But if the force drives me, it shakes me, this is micromotion.
Like the beam here, if you go through many lenses,
the beam does up and down and up and down.
This is micromotion.
The micromotion is at cosine omega t.
And the net attractive force comes
because the force which oscillates it,
cosine omega t, and I'm oscillating at cosine omega t,
then you get cosine square omega t.
And this gives you the net force,
which provides the net attractive force,
and it is the cosine square term averaged
over the micromotion, which is one half, which
is responsible for the trapping potential in ion paths.
Anyway you know the physics very well.
You understand where the math comes from.
It's really just the product of the two.
Selectificaton.
It's an alternating force, but since the system itself,
the particle itself, is driven at the micromotion there
is a rectification going on which leads
to the cosine square term.

[INAUDIBLE], yes?

So, I think [INAUDIBLE] travellers complained about
the micromotion, but in fact, they need it for travelling
to work.
That's pretty much what's going on here right?
Yes, actually, [INAUDIBLE] side of the mathematics
is the micromotion is kinetic energy.
The harmonic trapping potential if nothing else
than the micromotion.
In other words, if people saw in an ion trap
that you have a harmonic oscillator
the harmonic oscillator potential is higher here.
But mathematically, this harmonic oscillator potential
is the kinetic energy of the micromotion.
In other words, if you look at the micromotion
it has a kinetic energy, the kinetic energy
appears as a potential energy in this slow circular motion.
So in other words, the potential energy for the trap
is the kinetic energy of the micromotions.
You can't avoid it.
It's-- this is responsible for the restoring force
Is it quite a conservative trap?
Or can it have an out of phase component
to the micromotion response?
Is there a sin part to the response?
It's just-- well the circular motion is quite conservative.
You know asking--
I'm trying to think if there would be a reason why
my-- the response-- my dipole response
would be having something different.

Is there a reason?

Well, to the best of my knowledge, it's all--
everything is wonderfully conservative
if you have a separation of time scale.
If you want to sort of, get something
strange or non-conservative out of the micromotion
you have to violate the adiabatic separation
of timescales.
It's the possibility that if particles move quickly
through the potential they are not following the micromotion
adiabatically.
And then there is a collision where micromotion is released
as condition of energy.
But on the single particle level,
it's a pretty good approximation.
