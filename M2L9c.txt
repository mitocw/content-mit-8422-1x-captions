Let's get to the main subject we want to discuss now.
And these are actually Feynman diagrams.
I wanted to give you an exact definition
and a deep understanding what does
it mean when we talk about processes of absorption
and emission, but also about absorption emission
processes which violate energy.
And some people refer to them as virtual photons.
The reason is that virtual photons cannot really exist
for a long time.
When you emit a virtual photon, another photon
has to be absorbed immediately to reconcile
energy conservation, as we want to see in a moment.
So the goal of this presentation is
I want you that you realize that each of those doodles
has an exact mathematical meaning.

Each of those diagrams represents one term
or class of terms in an exact solution for the time
evolution of the system.

So in other words, if you would ask me--
we have a ground and excited state--
is it possible that the ground state emits a photon,
goes to virtual state, emits another photon
of another frequency, and then somehow absorbs a photon.
It goes to here and eventually takes another photon,
and is back to the current state.
Is that a possibility?
Can that happen?
And I think what the message here is,
yes, everything happens.
The system is trying out all of its possibilities.
And that two-time evolution is the sum
over those possibilities, over all the amplitudes related
to those diagrams.
But what I want to show you is how the weirder the diagrams
get, the more you go in energy below the ground state,
the more you go away from real atomic states, the bigger
in your energy denominator.
And that means those diagrams have
a smaller and smaller weight.
And in all practical calculations we neglect those.
But I want you to be able to see that and realize
I exactly know what it means.
It means this and this term in a summation
over all the amplitudes, which the quantum
system is exploding.
And I think with that we really learn something about physics.
We learn about what is actually inside the Schrodinger
equation.
A lot of people actually, before they take this class,
think that this is just nonsense.
That this has no physical reality.
But I hope after this class, you see
that pretty much everything you draw has physical reality.
It's just, it may not contribute a lot.
So what we have done, and let me just start here
and invite your questions.
We have figured out how an initial state evolves
with a time evolution operator to another basis
state toward the final state.
And formally, this is the formal solution, an exact solution
of the Schrodinger equation.
We have to sum over all orders, orders in the interaction.
Well, I will immediately tell you
what is the first and second order.
We're not going much higher.
But if you want, here you can.
And then what you have to do is in the time evolution,
you have to sum over intermediate times.
You have to allow the system to propagate, to change its state,
propagate again, change its state again.
And the times where the change of state happens that
can happen at any time between your initial
and your final time.
And we integrate over all possible times.
And I showed you, and I think this was the very
last thing we did on Wednesday.
I showed you how this diagram can be translated
into a mathematical equation.
And I think I picked a second-order diagram.
But I think from the way how I presented,
it should be clear now how any such diagram can
be translated into an equation.
And eventually you have to perform an integral
over all intermediate times.
