Let me introduce the other relevant parameter, which
will also have indices, and that is we
have to bring in the interactions.
We want to describe an interacting system.
We describe an interacting system using the short range
approximation by assuming that two particles interact
with the delta function.
And if we have two particles on side, each of them
has a density, which is the Wannier function squared,
and the product of the two densities integrated
gives us the expectation value for the repulsive energy.
And this is given here.
So the moment we introduce interactions,
we are now interested in the interaction energy
between two particles, which in this case occupy the same side.
OK.
So I've tried to introduce what, sort of, J is.
J is a matrix element between two Wannier functions
with the Hamiltonian in between.
And U is the matrix element of two Wannier functions
with the interaction operator in between.
And now I want to use that concept
to take my full Hamiltonian and transform
from field operator localized at x to Wannier functions.
So the B operator are now creation operators.
They create an atom in the Wannier function.
In other words, you know, B dega means
you have a particle in a Wannier function at site I.
And I just use it as a basis transformation
and the exact transformation of this Hamiltonian
is now into this form.
So what I have right now is I have the tunneling matrix
element between particles inside I and J
and I have to sum over all of them.
And in terms of interaction, I can calculate this matrix
element by using Wannier function
with four different indicies and ask what happens.
And this is simply an exact way of rewriting it.
And here I've given you the definition.
So if you want, Matt, forget everything
I told you about J and U. I've done
a transformation, an exact transformation,
from field operators to Wannier function creation operators.
And this introduces tunneling terms like the this,
from side I to side J. And this here
includes products of four Wannier functions
which are responsible for the interaction term.
Actually if this is not complicated enough,
I've suppressed bent indices here.
I should also now sum over all possible bents.
But OK, I want to come now to the leading approximation
in a tight binding model.
And that is where, I mean, those Wannier functions
are overlapped.
Two neighboring Wannier functions
barely overlap, if I go further away
the overlap becomes even smaller.
So the most dominant term are nearest neighbor interactions.
And the nearest neighbor interaction
is where I and J differ by one and this is
what I call J without indices.
And similarly when it comes to the interaction term
where we have products of four Wannier functions, well,
and we want to get the overlap of all four,
and then multiplied with G, the prefect of our delta
function to get an interaction term,
well, the best overlap is if all indices are the same.
And this is what I call U. So in that limit,
in that tight binding limit, my Hamiltonian is now very simple.
It consists of the tunneling term parametrized
with J and then on side interaction term parametrized
with U. Yes.
When we are saying I, J, and K and they are all the same.
So the interaction is with the particle itself?
No.
Two particles per side.
When the four particles are the same it turns into--

this Hamiltonian here has all indices are the same
and if you calculate that it turns into the product of two.
B-b dega is occupation number at each side,
but if you are careful with commutators
it becomes occupation number times occupation number
minus one.
If you have only one particle per side this term is zero.
So technically U is if you put in 2 times, 2 times 1.
If you have two particles per side,
U in the interaction energy between two particles.
Just use this expression to figure out
what it is for three or four, but for one particle
you get zero.
The self interaction of a particle is absolutely zero.
One particle does not interact with itself.

I guess back to my question with the hopping, so when you have I
equals I or I equals J for the hopping term--
Yes.
Do you just--
No.
I assume-- No.
I-J is nearest neighbor I assume that the index I and J
differ by one.
Well, yeah, I mean so your argument
was that the best over that was between nearest neighbors?
Yes.
But, so I mean an overlap of the Wannier function is with,
like at the same site, is just sort of the kinetic energy term
is it approximately zero or you just absorb that
into the chemical potential.
This is zero.
If you take the lowest band its a zero point energy.
It's common to all of them.
P squared it's--
So we are only looking at nearest neighbor,
so we essentially are saying the case
where I equals J is approximately zero
Just commonly.
Because it's the major term of the Hamiltonian
Yeah.
So P, the kinetic, plus the lattice operator
so if I take my Wannier function which is built out of--
I get values for that equation.
I get a sum over a bunch of energy terms.
On every side it clears that they are the same.
So you have a common mode of energy that you can list.
What would then multiply by the B dega B.
Yeah.
I feel like in some sense it would
have to be in charge of the chemical potential.
My gut feeling is, and this is why nobody considers it,
it's just the constant energy, which is probably
something like the zero point energy
times the number of particles, which
is not effecting any dynamics.
It's pretty much a constant, which can be simply dropped.

Let me just go back to that slide.
I hope-- let me just look up the reference.
I haven't looked at it recently.
When we do this exact transformation
there should be a reference.
Whether I and J are--
what happens when I equals J, I think
it's just a constant term.
Because then you are summing over every single lattice.
Don't you?
So you get the number of particles times zero point
energy.
Yeah, but even mathematically, it keeps just a constant term
here, which is neglected.
Thanks.
It was good to clarify it.
