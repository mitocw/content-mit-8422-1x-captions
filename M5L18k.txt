Let's talk about the homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate
and weak interactions.
If you write down the Hamiltonian
for the interdictions, it will appear many, many times.
The general way to write down interactions between two
particles is you annihilate particles in momentum k and p,
and then they reappear different momenta.
So one momentum gets upshifting by q,
and one momentum gets downshifted by q.
This guarantees momentum conservation.
So what I'm showing you here is the elementarily process
of scattering two particles with momentum k and p scatter,
disappear.
That's why we have the annihilation operator.
And then they reappear two new momenta.
That's the most general form of a binary interaction.
And now we have to make approximations.
Nobody can solve this Hamiltonian
in the most generally way.
So one approximation we make is that, since the range
of the atomic interactions is much smaller than the distance
between atoms or the [INAUDIBLE] wavelengths,
we approximate the potential by a short range
potential, or delta function, where
the Fourier of the delta function is constant.
And that would mean, in momentum space,
this momentum dependent matrix element squared
is just constant.
So therefore, we can approximate the Hamiltonian
by a constant interaction parameter,
and then we have the sum over all these creation annihilation
operators.
I don't want to go into details of low energy scattering
physics, but it is most convenient to describe
this parameter by u naught, which
is the Fourier transform of the interaction potential.
Or very often we parametrize it with the s-waves scattering
lenghts, which is the only relevant parameter
for elastic collisions at low temperature.
So with that, we have now an Hamiltonian,
which has kinetic energy.
And here is the potential energy,
due to the interaction between the atoms.
And we have taken this constant Fourier transform u naught out
of the summation.
Now I mentioned already to you that a product of four
operators cannot be solved.
You need an approximation where you
reduce the number of operators from four to two,
and then you solve a quadratic equation,
and the solution is Bogoliubov solution.
So how do we reduce, now, this product of four operators
to two?
Well, when we have a condensate where many, many atoms are
in one quantum state, we can make the Bogoliubov
approximation.
The Bogoliubov approximation is, well,
if the creation annihilation operator in this zero momentum
state for the condensate has the following matrix element.
And now you can say if n naught--
the number of atoms in the condensate-- is large, well,
we can sort of neglect the difference
between naught and naught plus 1 and naught minus 1.
And we simply make the approximation
that the operator a naught and a naught [? dega ?]
is replaced by the square root of a naught.
And then in this sum of [? aquatic ?] terms,
we only keep those terms which have at least two occurrences
of the index zero.
Because the terms which have, for instance,
no occurrence of the index zero, have
a mul-- don't get this multiplier a naught.
So we do an expansion in powers of a naught, and we stop here.

So therefore now, if we make sure that any combination
of those two involves the index the zero,
we factor out a naught, and then we have products of k minus k
with [? dega ?] [? dega ?] k minus k annihilation operator,
or we have mixed term [? a dega ?] k a of k a minus k
[? dega ?] a minus k.
But this is what we get.
The next step is purely technical.
We want to get rid of a naught and replace it by n.
So inn is a naught plus the sum of the population
in all other momentum states.
And that's now our Hamiltonian, which still looks complicated,
but it can immediately be solved, because all it involves
is a quadratic product of operators.
OK, so what I want to show you is
that the moment you have bilinear operators,
all you have to do is, in essence,
you have to solve a quadratic equation.
And because with all the indices and constants
it looks a little bit complicated,
let me just say that the structure of this Hamiltonian
involves sums which are a of k and a of minus k. k minus case
is of course important because that's important for momentum
conservation.
So let me now call a of k a, and a of minus k b.
Then this Hamiltonian has the following structure.
It has terms a dagger a, b dagger b, b dagger b.
But then it has the other terms, a dagger b dagger plus ba.
Now let me put it this way.
If that wouldn't exist, we would be
done, because a Hamiltonian, which
has e0 a dagger a is a harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian.
It is diagonalized.
a and a dagger are just Eigen operators,
which create quasiparticles with energy e0.
So if we could eliminate this term, we would be done.
So therefore, let's follow Pogoliubov
and say that we introduce new operators alpha, beta.
And the alpha, beta operators are linear combinations
of a and b, or vice versa a and b
are linear combinations of the new operators, alpha, beta.
And since we have a bosonic system,
and we think it's a good idea to keep it the system bosonic,
we require that those new operators fulfill
bosonic commutation relations.
Those bosonic commutation relations
are fulfilled if u square minus v square--
u and v are the linear coefficients,
which express ab in terms of alpha and beta, if that is 1.
So in other words, u and v are now two new parameters.
One condition for u and v is ful--
is used up to ensure the bosonic character of alpha and beta.
But now we have a second condition.
We kind of have two conditions for parameters.
So what we do is we just rewrite this Hamiltonian
in terms of alpha, beta.
And that's what we get.
It's a bilinear Hamiltonian with a linear transformation stays
bilinear.
But now our second condition, which we can impose on u and v,
is that the prefactor of this cross product is 0.
So then by using those conditions for u and v--
and you find the equations in many textbooks.
I'm not discussing them in great detail here.
We have obtained a Hamiltonian of this kind,
and this is diagonalized.
We know now that alpha, beta create quasiparticles
at a certain energy.
So now by going back, I mean, alpha, beta
were expressed by a and b.
a was a of k. b was a of minus k.
I just go back to the original nomenclature.
But we have diagonalized the Hamiltonian.
So what we have achieved now is our Hamiltonian
is written in this following way.
Actually, I've recycled a now. a is no longer a particle
in a given momentum state.
It's now a quasiparticle.
So we have now diagonalized the Hamiltonian
for the weakly interacting Bose gas, and what we have obtained
is, well, we have the full solution, everything
you want to know about this system
we know, and in particular, we know
what are the characteristic excitation
energies for quasiparticle.
And this quasiparticle energy gives us
the energy as a function of momentum
by replacing the parameter u0 by c--
c is the speed of sound.
I can rewrite it like this.
And you see that it makes sense immediately,
because we have now a dispersion relation, which
in the limit of high momenta, is just the normal kinetic energy.
So the quasiparticles are free particles.
Whereas at low momentum, when this term dominates,
the dispersion relation is linear.
And linear means sound and phonons.
Bose-Einstein condensation is a low-energy phenomenon,
so you should not expect that you
change any characteristics of higher energy quasiparticles.
If you wreck a particle in the Bose-Einstein condensate
with high energy, it flies out at a high-energy particle.
But a low-energy excitation creates sound waves.
So this is what we have found now.
