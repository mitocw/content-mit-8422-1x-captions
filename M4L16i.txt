Any question?
[INAUDIBLE]
What if there is a net change in the atom's function?
The energy still has a [INAUDIBLE]
can make that one move three times faster if you want.

This question has bothered me in many different iterations.
And at some point I found a very, very easy answer to that.
And this is one of your homework assignments
for homework number 10.
There is a very simple example where you will
realize where the energy comes.

What happens is, in steady state if everything
is stationary, of course there can't be an exchange.
But if you are, for instance, saying--
and I give you now part of the solution, if you have atoms
and they are attracted by the dipole force.
There is a strong laser beam and the atoms are accelerated in.
And you are now asking, where does the energy come from?
Because all what the atoms do, at least according
to what I'm telling you, they redistribute
photons of energy HPA omega into photons of energy HPA omega.
So where does the energy come from?
You have to go higher in the approximation here
to understand where the energy comes from.
Let me just tell you one thing.
This is actually something which I've encountered several times.
And it can be really confusing.
I've really proven to you mathematically
that this is false.
So in this level of treatment with these very simple
concepts, we correctly obtain the optical false.
But if you are now asking--

where does the energy go?
You have to go deeper.
And for instance, what happens is,
if you take a cloud of atoms and the cloud of atoms
moves in and out of a laser beam--
just think of it as center of mass dipole oscillations
of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical dipole trap.
What happens is, when the atoms move in and out
they actually act as a phase modulator for the laser beam.
The index of refraction of your laser beam is changing.
So therefore-- and we don't deal with that
when we replace the electromagnetic field
by a c-number.
Your laser beam when the atoms move in
will actually show a frequency modulation.
And you will find-- and it's a wonderful homework assignment.
I'm pretty proud that we created that and that it works out
so easily.
You will find that the kinetic energy of the atoms
is exactly compensated by the energy
shift of the photons which have passed through the atoms.
But I'm giving you a very advanced answer.
It's often very difficult. If you
have a simple picture for the force to figure out
what happens to the energy.

Actually, let me give you the other example.
The previous example, we have atoms
and we have a laser beam which cools with radiation pressure.
This was our previous example.
Where does the energy go?
Our wonderful correct within the assumptions
and exact expression for the force.
Where does the energy go?

The atoms have a counter-propagating laser beam.
They scatter photos with this rate.
Every time they scatter a photon,
they slow down by h-bar K. They lose energy.
We have a complete description what
happens in the momentum picture and in forces.

Where does the energy go?
The energy the atoms have lost.
They absorb a slightly higher frequency
because of the Doppler shift.
And then slow down and then re-release a photon
of slightly lower energy.
Exactly.
So in that case, it's actually depends which way.
When the atom loses energy, the energy
goes into blueshifted photons.
I'm just saying, in order to address the question-- what
happens to the energy, we have to bring in, now, physics
which we didn't even consider to address here.
It is now the physics of the spontaneously emitted photons.
We said for the force spontaneous emission,
vacuum fluctuations can be eliminated.
But if you try to understand, where does energy go?
We have to go to those terms.
And we even find the physics of Doppler shifts,
which we didn't put in it, which we didn't even assume here.
But of course it has to be self-consistent.
So therefore you sometimes have to go to very different physics
which is not even covered by your equation to see
the flip side of the coin.
One side is forces, which are very simple.
But the other side of the coin can be more difficult.
We'll actually come back to that when
we talk about cooling blue molasses,
cooling with a simulated force.
How can a simulated force cool?
Because it's all you.
We'll get there.
And it will again be--
the energy will be extracted through spontaneous emission
form all those side bends and all that.
So we have to trace down the energy.
And we successfully will do that.
But energy can be subtle.
Forces are simple.

Other questions?

Actually when I explain to you where the energy goes
in a dipole trap that it's a phase modulation for the laser
beam--
I have been using optical dipole traps
in my laboratory for many, many years
before I really figured out where the energy goes.
And I'm almost 99% certain.
If you go to [INAUDIBLE] and ask some of the experts
on cooling and trapping and ask them to figure out
this problem, most of the people will not
be able to give you this answer.
I've actually not found the answer
in any standard textbook of laser
cooling until I eventually found it myself and post it
and prepared it as a homework assignment.
So many, many people may not be able to give you
the correct answer.
Where does the energy go when atoms slosh around
in a dipole trap.
Try it out at [INAUDIBLE] it may be fun.
