But now comes the interesting physics.
We have to ask, what are we doing here?
I mean, it's all mathematical.
And the math is really simple here.
What we have done is we have looked at the isolating state,
and we have done perturbation [? phi oe ?] in psi times
b plus b dagger.
And now, we get an energy correction,
which is psi square.
And I mean, what are we really doing here?
Well, you can say the following.
We started with a hypothesis that we have a superfluid state
characterized by psi.
And psi, at the onset of superfluid, is small.
But now, we have done the calculation,
assuming that there is a psi.
But now, we are turning around and said,
have we really done the system a favor
by introducing superfluidity?
In other words, has our perturbation [? phi oe ?]
in psi lowered the energy of this state?
Or raised the energy of this state?
So in other words, we've done a hypothetical calculation here.
What would the system feel like if there were
a little bit of superfluity?
If the system says, great, I've lowered my energy,
then we know we're in the superfluid state.
When the system says, no, I raise my energy because
of the psi, then the system has rejected our idea
to introduce superfluidity.
So therefore, the question we are raising now
is, after we've done the calculation, for what values
of u and j is it favorable to introduce a psi or not?
Now, I was expecting the question of some of you that,
in second order perturbation [? phi oe, ?] second order
perturbation [? phi oe ?] always lowers the energy.
But remember, this is why I emphasized the minus sign.
We had a psi square term, which came
from that, which came from the last term of the decoupling
approximation, which had a minus sign.
And therefore, we have, in psi square,
one term which came from this special psi--
and I emphasized in the decoupling approximation--
entry of a contribution of psi square, which
comes from perturbation [? phi oe. ?]
And the two together can actually change their sign.
So what we have right now is, if we describe the ground state
as a function of psi, we have our unperturbed energy
of the Mott insulating states.
And then, we have a term in psi square.
And we should-- and we could, but we don't--
calculate the next order in psi to the 4.
And it turns out that, in 4th order perturbation
[? phi oe, ?] this term is always positive.
So what happens now to the total energy, when this term, a2,
which we have exactly calculated,
analytically calculated, if this term, a2,
is larger or smaller than zero.
Well, if you have a parabolic term and a quartic term,
in this case, both the quadratic and the quartic term
are opening up, like in a u-shape.
But here, the total energy turns into w-shape.
And the interpretation is fairly simple.
Under those conditions, the system
prefers to have psi equal 0.
Whereas, here, it's like the system
wants to have a psi parameter which is finite,
either positive or negative.
And whether it's positive or negative
is sometimes called spontaneous symmetry breaking between two
degenerate solutions.
What I'm showing here is, of course,
very similar to the Ginzburg-Landau theory of phase
transitions where you have an effective potential,
and the phase transition takes place when the second order
coefficient changes sign, and the effective potential turns
from U-shape into W-shape.
So that's what we have done.

So anyway, I think this is a nice problem where
the interpretation is, I think, much more subtle
than the calculation itself.
But we have calculated the phase transition.
Everything is analytic.
Here is the analytic result, which
I know with very indigestible notation.
The paper-- I followed exactly the paper
by [? Wunderstraden ?] [? Stoof ?] and collaborators,
which is posted on the website.
You can plot this phase diagram in this way.
But if you use what is more common, normalize,
there can be the potential by u and normalize j by u,
you get these wonderful lobes of the Mott insulator
where you see that, if you increase
the chemical potential, you have n
equals 1, n equals 2, n equals 3, Mott insulator.
And in between, you go through superfluid regions.
However, if your tunneling is larger,
if your tunneling is too large, you're only superfluid.
So this is sort of the way how you
derive this rather rich phase diagram of bosonic atoms
in an optical lattice.
Green is an insulating state, and white
is the superfluid state.

Let me just conclude by showing a few slides, how
this can be observed.
So in one case, we have an insulating state
with indefinite number of particles per site.
And here, we have superfluid state,
which has the normal fluctuations in number.
Here's another cartoon picture of a condensate in the lowest
Bloch wave function.
And here, you have localized number states.
Often, you observe the transition
by taking this system and releasing it in time of light
into ballistic expansion.
If the superfluid is coherent, the wave function
on the different sites is coherent,
and what you get is a multi-slit interference pattern, which
is a diffraction pattern.
And you see these characteristic diffraction patterns.
It's an [? end-slit ?] diffraction pattern,
which characterizes the coherence in the initial state.
However, if you have a completely isolating state,
you have a Gaussian wave packet on each site, which has nothing
to do with the next neighbor.
And then, the Gaussian wave function simply
expands in a structureless way.
And so, the transition from here to there
happens exactly when the ratio of u over j
crosses the value we have derived.

There is another technique of observing
that which is more recent.
This is quantum gas microscopes, where
you do the same physics in two dimensions.
So you have only one plane where this physics takes place,
and you can observe atoms now with a microscope.
So each green dot here is an atom.

You can sort of zoom in.
And if you now study the region where
you go through the superfluid to the Mott insulator,
you see that you have exactly one atom per site.
If you increase the atom number, you have an insulator
with one atom per site.
And in the middle, you have an atom.
Here you have a state with two atoms per site
which, for reasons I don't want to discuss,
are color coded here in black.
And that sort of goes on and goes on.
So you can't really resolve, site per site,
the occupation of the number of atoms per site.
So I think I'll stop here with the [INAUDIBLE] gases.
When you think the Mott insulator is
the end of the story, all motion has been frozen out,
and you have one particle per site, well,
it could be the beginning of a new story.
Because if you use two different hyperfine states,
spin up and spin down, we can talk about spin ordering.
