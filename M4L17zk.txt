OK, sub-recoil cooling-- we can quickly deal with it,
because I want to prove to you here that sub-recoil cooling is
impossible.
And unless you tell me what is wrong in my derivation,
I don't need to discuss the sub-recoil cooling,
because I've convinced you that it's impossible.
OK, so let's assume our atom has an initial kinetic energy.
And then we absorb one photon.
That would mean that the momentum has now
changed by the laser photon, by the recoil.
And then it emits a photon.
So the momentum gets reduced by the emitted photon.
And all I do is I ask, what is the difference
between the initial kinetic energy
and the final kinetic energy after two photons, a laser
photon and this spontaneously-emitted photon,
have been exchanged.
And what you find is-- and this is just exact--
that the change in energy is two times the recoil energy--
the recoil energy is h bar square k square over 2m--

and this is now the cause term--
plus kL, the k vector of the laser,
minus K spontaneous emission times the velocity.
And now, of course, we assume--
which is correct-- that spontaneous emission goes
randomly in all directions.
So therefore, if you average over many cycles,
this does not contribute.
So therefore, we find now that the average energy exchanged
by an absorption and emission event is 2 times
the recoil energy plus h bar k laser times v.
And if you want to make it negative,
because we want to cool, well, we
make it negative by arranging the laser beam--
surprise, surprise-- counter-propagating
to the velocity.
This is how we can get the best cooling.
Well, surprise.
That's what we expected.
But you find, of course, that when
this velocity is very small, then kv
is smaller than k square.
So therefore, once the velocity is smaller than the recoil
velocity of a single photon, you cannot make this equation
or this expression go negative.
In other words, what I've shown to
you is, if there is an atom, which
has a velocity which is smaller than the recoil velocity
of a photon, whenever this atom scatters
a single photon it will be hotter than it was before.

So is it clear what I've shown you in energy?
When an atom has a velocity which
is smaller than the recoil velocity,
any further photon scattering will not cool.
It will lead to an energy transfer delta-E, which
is large, which is positive.

So that shows you that sub-recoil cooling
is impossible.

Any idea how we can sub-recoil cool?
Any idea why Claude Cohen-Tannoudji
got the Nobel Prize?
[INAUDIBLE] in the lattice, you can
have an effective mass that is much
heavier that the bare mass?
OK, great idea.
We put the atom in a lattice.
A lattice has bent structure.
In a bent structure, we have an effective mass.
And heavier atoms can be cooled to a lower and lower
temperature.
Actually, it's well-known that in Doppler cooling
and sub-Doppler cooling--
especially in sub-Doppler cooling--
caesium and rubidium reach a microkelvin.
Sodium reaches only 25 microkelvin.
So making the atom heavier is OK.
But I have to say, you're only rescaling your recoil limit.
You're not breaking through the recoil limit,
which is now defined with a heavier effective mass.
[INAUDIBLE] the spontaneous emission direction?
And--
Yes.
--is that the atom must do the spontaneous emission
a lot of times.
Yes.
And-- yeah.
That was the assumption.
It means that, at least for this cooling,
it needs the time much larger than the [INAUDIBLE]
instructions in [INAUDIBLE] time?
Well, that was the assumption here.
We scatter several times.
The spontaneously emitted photon do not contribute--
the recoil of the spontaneously-emitted photons
cancels out.
Because spontaneous emission-- and this is correct,
this is not wrong-- spontaneous emission
goes equally probable in the plus x and the minus x
direction.
Well, I thought I want to show you
a mechanical demonstration, how you can sub-recoil cool.
It's not a demonstration in velocity space.
It's a demonstration in position space.
What I have here is a Plexiglas tray.
And it has a little hole in the middle.
And I have a bunch of ball bearings.
And I put those ball bearings in.
Let me translate.

I will be blind.
I can blindfold myself.
And all I do is I shake the tray.
So whenever I shake it, I kick the atoms randomly,
in position space, from here to here.
So the amount of position control I have over the atoms
is on the order of this size.
But the question is, can I, without having
any control of the transfer of position I give to them,
can I steer all the atoms into an area
here into the hole in the middle, which is very, very
narrow in position space?
So the translation is, if I randomly scatter photons
and I kick the atoms around with h bar k--
I don't have any control about momentum
transfer smaller than h bar k--
is it possible to localize the atoms in momentum space
to a momentum around 0, which is much,
much smaller than h bar k.
Well, let's do the experiment.
I just close my eyes and I shake it.
And I shake it.
And I just shake it for a while.
And I continue shaking it.
And well, 0 temperature.
So without controlling the motion on the scale
I'm interested in, I manage to cool into a target region,
which is much, much narrower.
So in other words, all you need is
you need some dark state which is velocity-selective.
If you scatter light, but you create a situation where,
once the atoms are close to 0 velocity, they are not excited.
You're not steering the atoms in a deterministic way.
You just wait until, by random chance, one photon is emitted.
And by random chance, the atom hits the hole.
And then it will never be re-excited again.
This was the idea of this demonstration.
And yes, in the old days, I may have
spent two hours on teaching it.
But by using Raman resonances between ground states, which
are terribly narrow, or by using VSCPT, Velocity Selective
Cohesion Population Trapping, you
can create such narrow dark resonances
which have the effect that the atoms
scatter, scatter, scatter.
But the moment they reach a very narrow region around 0
velocity, they stop scattering.
So what was wrong in my proof is that, here, we
have a situation where we stop the laser cooling exactly
at the time when the atom, by random chance,
happens to be at very low velocity.
And then you don't need any control.
You just accumulate, in the same way
as I accumulated the ball bearings.

OK, this was sub-recoil cooling in five minutes.
Timor?
So I was going to ask about-- the summarized Doppler cooling
rate gets us to a temperature on the order of gamma,
which is natural alignment.
Yes.
And the recoil limit is the recoil energy, which is usually
in tenths of kilograms.
But if you have a really, really narrow line,
would you use the Doppler cooling with it?
You could, in principle, beat the recoil limit
with Doppler cooling, no?
If you have a--
No, you can't.
Because if you do Doppler cooling--
Timor's question is, if you simply
do molasses with a very, very narrow line,
we derived that the limit of Doppler cooling
is k-t equals gamma.
And what you are saying now, if you
use narrower and narrower lines, can we
reach arbitrary low temperature?
This is not the case.

In our derivation of Doppler cooling,
we made a continuum of assumptions.
When we plotted the force versus velocity
and we had the friction force, we
assumed that an atom, when it scatters a photon,
stays, let's say, within the linear part
of the force versus velocity.
So we had a hidden assumption, which
required that the recoil energy is smaller than h bar gamma.
But there is a lot of literature where people looked into it.
And it turns out that, when you have a very narrow line,
you can go to the recoil limit, but you can't go beyond.
If you want to go--
and I think this is what I showed you
in the last five minutes--
if you want to go below the recoil limit,
you need some velocity-selective dark state.
And you would not have that in this situation.
On the other hand, if you have a very narrow resonance,
you can probably engineer a dark state
that there is destructive interference
in some excitation in a very, very narrow velocity class.
And this narrow velocity class is simply
selected by the Doppler effect.
So you can use the narrow line to engineer sub-recoil cooling.
But the simple arrangement of just having molasses
with narrower and narrow line will not work.
Collin.
I think the group that laser cooled the BEC--
their dark state was just a [? stark ?] ship,
like [? green ?] being in the middle of the cloud.
And it shifted-- their resonance is
like a kilohertz or something.
They used a very--
did they go below the recoil limit in laser cooling?
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
They may have had a situation where
it was enough to go to the recoil limit.
And I have to check up their paper, but--
But I remember they did have some sort of dark state.
Maybe it was to increase density?
Or-- they had to [INAUDIBLE].
Anyway, let me just be clear.
Sub-recoil cooling requires that you have a dark region
in velocity space.
For that, you need some narrow line width.
That's necessary.
But I think you just don't get it
by having [INAUDIBLE] propagating the laser beams.
You have to do something more.

Other question?
