Now we go from Cooper to BCS.
Those three guys figured out how they can now
take the physics described by Cooper,
and really fold it into a correct many-body formalism.
In other words, not to artificially have two
fermions which scatter and there is just
a Fermi-C of the other ones.
They were now treating the two electrons, which
scatter on equal footing with the whole Fermi-C.
So now we have democracy, all electrons are created equal.
So, I want to derive for you with the BCS wave
function in the way which was not
to be done by Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer,
but it makes an immediate analogy with Bose Einstein
Condensation.
So what happens is you could have now the idea, of course
I'm very suggestive in leading you to this idea,
two fermions form a pair.
And if the pairs both condense, then each pair
should be identical.
So maybe we should take our n-particles, our n-fermions,
in half spin up and half spin down, each of them
should form a pair, so one and two
forms a pair of three and four forms a pair and such,
and then we see our wave function of identical fermion
pairs slash bosons is just a product of those pairs.
But the molecular wave function and molecular of function
if you want so far, is the same for all particles.
So this is just like in the Bose Einstein condensate,
we have a particle state of n times the same wave
function, here we have a product state of n over 2 times
the same pairing wave function.
Well, the-- we should anti-symmetrize.
That's important.
So now let's just see what we got.
Well we describe everything in second quantization.
We use fuede operators which create particles
at a certain position, and then we
have the wave function of the pairs
to make sure they are created in the right--
in the right position.
We transform everything, our operators
and do fully transform, if we go,
from operators in position space to operate us
in momentum space.
But now, it's just formulas and you can read up about it.
But the important thing is now I define a pair creation
operator.
This pair creation operator creates one of those pairs.
And what it does is it creates, we want to focus on the pairs
with 0 momentum, so it forms a plain wave, firmly
on the momentum state with minus k,
with opposite spin with plus k.
So these are sort of two opposite plain waves
with 0 momentum.
But now the reading factor is the Fourier transform
of this pairing wave function.
So if you have sort of if you want
to assume it's a molecular wave function,
Fourier transformers, and this is the waiting factor.
And with that definition, this is now
the creation operator of let's say, a molecule consisting
of two Fermions.
OK.
So now we can say, well maybe a good idea
of what describes our system is now, so to speak,
a Bose Einstein condensate where we create, in order,
two pairs out of the vacuum.
Well, first I want to show you that this is actually
the BCS wave function.
Most people do not use that form for the BCS wave function.
What I want to show you is that it's mathematically
identical to the BCS wave function.
But first I have to clarify, is that really a Bose condensate?
If I would have shown you this equation
without telling you anything about what,
yeah it looks exactly, and over two
identical b-bose, bosonic particles.
But now we have to be more careful.
We have our definition for the pairing operator
and now we can calculate all those bosons.
So let's just look at the commutator between [? b-degA ?]
[? b-degA ?] b, b, yes fine, fine.
But now the commutator between b and [? b-degA ?] is not 1.
It would be 1, if the probability
that the population of one of those plane waves key, if that
is much, much smaller than one, then the commutator
is fulfilled.
But the population of momentum states
depends on the size of the pair.
If the size is huge.
You have no lying momentum states
which have a huge population.
If the size is small of the pair,
you can say, in a tightly bound system
particles have so much zero point energy
that every given momentum state has pretty much zero
occupation.
So in other words, this criterion
here tells us that our pairs are bosons if nK
Is much smaller than one, but if in case not smaller than one,
then those pairs act out in a fermionic way.
And the criterion happens exactly when
the size of the pairs is comparable to the particle
spacing.
So in other words, what we have described what this wave
function is we have a wave function,
which is two- Bose Einstein condensate
for tightly bound pairs.
It's what we expect.
It still has this form, but those pairs now
feel the Fermi pressure, and therefore we have--
this is automatically taken account in the formalism.
Colin?
So what's the minus sign?
On the commutator?
This one?
[INAUDIBLE]
It's a commutator, not the anti-commutator.
It's b, b-dega minus b-dega, b.
I just wanted to be careful here because for fermions you often
will see anti-commutator, but I want
to check whether these are bosons,
so I use the pulsonic, the commutator, not
the anti-commutator.
Let me just show you one thing real quick.
Namely, that this wave function is identical to the famous BCS
wave function.
Well, almost not quite you know that this
is a state which has n particles in over two pairs.
Remember when we talked about photons,
we had Fock states within particles, within photons.
But we also had coherent states where alpha square was n,
but this was sort of, a classical coherent state.
And this coherent state could be expanded
as a sum over Fock states.
And one can now say, to some extent,
when it comes to certain properties of light in photons,
sometimes it's important to distinguish whether we have
a Fock state or coherent state, but for many things,
if you have any photons in the same state,
you can have a laser, then you have a coherent state,
or you have n-photons in a cavity
and, that may be similar.
So let me now show you what happens
when I take these Fock state, but construct what is now
the coherent state version.
In the coherent state version, I take,
this is a Fock state with j particles
but now we take a coherent superposition.
And I've chosen my effector such that I
will get the coherent state.
And indeed I get the coherent state.
So this is the same--
this is now sort of what the laser is for Fock state is
this coherent state for state with a specific from Fermial
number.
And this state now when I chose you can also
say, many-body physics we say, I just
went from the canonical ensemble,
which has a fixed number of atoms,
to the grand canonical ensemble, where the number of atoms
fluctuates.
But now I can simply use the definitions.
If I tailor expand this component,
because all higher powers of the fermionic creation operators
give zero, the tailor expansion ends after the first term.
And with one more step, I have the famous BCS wave function.
So therefore, the easiest wave function,
which has been widely used for, to describe superconductors,
is really identical to creating n
over 2 pair speed, identical pair speed in the vacuum.
And I'm just telling you that because that means now
mathematically, the BCS wave function, which many people say
describes a very, very different physics is formally
equivalent to the wave function for Bose Einstein Condensate.
OK.
So what have you done so far?
We talked about one particle physics,
how very weak attraction to bound states.
We realized that if fermions live on top of a Fermi-c
it gives them-- it gives at least
the binding, the energetic consideration,
a two dimensional character.
And we have two states.
And we have bound states for infinitesimal attraction.
And now we have used our intuition,
if those paths exist, if they form
kind of a Bose Einstein condensate
to construct a tidal wave function.
And now I want to take this tidal wave function
and show you how we can use it to solve the Many-body
Hamiltonian.
So so far, single particle physics, two particle physics,
intuition to get a tidal wave function.
But now we go to the many-body problem.
Colin?
Yeah, I'm a little bit confused.
Can you go to the last slide?
So the BCS wave function has the normal component and the pair
component, where does the normal component
come into the Bose thing?
This one?
Yeah.
Oh, we're talking here about t equals 0.
We're talking about a wave function.
We're not talking about finite temperature
where you're already [INAUDIBLE] over-excited states.
This is only zero temperature physics.
Was that your question?
Yeah.
100% Super-fluid f fraction.

OK, so we are back now--
Before we begin this, this may be a silly question
but, why is it that up has to pair with down?
I mean, it seems OK for up to pair with up, right?
You still have--
No, what happens is--
we have assumed here that we have short range interaction.
And up and up can never come close together because
of the power of exclusion.
But then In principle, if you just--
if you have a heat wave or whatever, attraction.
OK.
It could work.
You're talking about now different pairing mechanisms.
I'm talking here about the plain vanilla BCS s wave pairing,
and that means spin up and spin down pairing.

Also this is where I can work out the analogy with the BC--
BCS cos [INAUDIBLE] so I'm just giving you
the simplest example.
But yes, in helium free at high magnetic field,
you have one of the phases where up and up and up with p-waves,
