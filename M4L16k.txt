Questions?
Yes, Jean.
--The same process as a Raman process,
except for [INAUDIBLE]?
Or is it just a--
It is a Raman process.
Actually, everything is a Raman process here,
because in laser cooling, in everything
which involves the motion, the external degree of freedom
of the atoms, we have an atom in one momentum state.
Light scattering always has to involve the excited state.
And then, we go down to a different momentum state.
So therefore, laser cooling is nothing
else than Raman process, yes, the external degree
of freedom of the atom.
You may be used to use the word, Raman process,
more when you start in one hyperfine state
of the molecules in one vibration or rotation state,
and you go to another one.
But well, Raman, for vibration and rotational states
and hyperfine states, the word Raman is used all the time.
I usually use it also for the external motion,
because I think it really brings out
common features between all those different Raman
processes.
So you can actually say that the reactive force is stimulated
Raman process between two momentum states
where both legs are stimulated by laser beams.
In a standing wave, it would be the two legs
would be stimulated by the two traveling wave components
of the standing wave.
Whereas, the dissipative force is spontaneous Raman process
where one leg is driven by the laser,
and the other one comes from spontaneous emission.

Mickey?
When the atoms slow down, the stimulated emitted photon
has to [INAUDIBLE]?
And vice versa, when it accelerates [INAUDIBLE] with
the emitted photon must have--
So the spontaneously emitted photon?
Yeah.
Just I was thinking of actually the stimulated form
because they are not stimulated [? measurements. ?]
But I'm confused how, when the energy of the emitted photon
must be [INAUDIBLE] due to the phase modulation?
Or it can have both stimulant and [INAUDIBLE] frequency
than that.
I mean, this is--
I mean, we had the discussion after [? Bovi's ?] question.
If you up and down and you are stimulated,
you go up in a stimulated way, you go down
in a stimulated way, and both laser fields which
stimulate the transition have the same frequency omega,
you would actually see that there is no energy exchange.
So at our current level of description,
we have described where the force comes from,
but we don't understand yet where the energy goes
or where the energy comes from.
And this is really more sophisticated.
And I don't want to continue the discussion.
We will encounter one situation, and this
is in the [? tres ?] atom picture,
where we will discuss, in a week or so, Sisyphus cooling.
And we will find out that there is symmetries in the molar
triplet.
So again, we will find the missing energy
in spontaneous emission.
But if we don't have spontaneous emission, if we just
have atoms moving in an optical lattice
without spontaneous emission, it is really what I said,
the phase modulation.
And I would probably ask you, at this point,
to do the homework assignment and maybe
have a discussion afterwards.
Because then, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

Does that, at least--
you can take that as a preliminary answer?
Yes.
That's good.
So these are the two limiting cases.
One is spontaneous emission, and the other one
is phase modulation at a certain frequency.
One can be sustained in steady state.
You can spontaneously emit, and an atom
goes through a standing wave.
And this is sustainable.
Whereas, the phase modulation thing is actually a transient.
It's an oscillation, which is [? ADN ?]
Yeah.
Just there are some things there--
like, one is the--
one [INAUDIBLE].

Yeah.
Actually-- If that helps you, but it's the following.
I would sometimes say the--
you know, I like intuitive explanations
of quantum physics.
Let's assume I'm an atom.
I'm in a bruda tube standing wave.
And you don't know it yet, but I do Sisyphus cooling.
By just exchanging photons, a stimulated force,
I'm actually cooling.
And you would say, how is it possible?
Because all the photo exchanges involve
the same photon, the same energy,
how can I get rid of energy?
And I think what really happens is the following.
The atoms can lose momentum without energy.
But due to Heisenberg's uncertainty relationship,
this is possible.
So the atom is first taking care of its momentum,
is losing momentum by stimulated force.
And eventually, before its too late, it
has to do some spontaneous emission
where it is paying back its debts in energy to Heisenberg.
And of course, after a certain time, everything is OK.
The force was provided by exchanging photons
of identical frequency.
And the energy is provided by an occasional spontaneous emission
event, using one of the molar sidebands.
So everything is there.
Everything is a perfect picture, but you
have to sort of, in this description,
allow a certain uncertainty that the force is
the exchange of identical photons,
and the energy balance is reconciled
in spontaneous emission.
And on any longer time scale, there
are enough events that the balance is perfectly matched.
But if you will take the position, no, this is not
possible, the atom can only--
has to-- with one--
I mean, its sort of in diagrams.
It's not that one diagram which scatters a photon
has to conserve energy.
You have a little bit of time.
You have Heisenberg's uncertainty time
to sort of make sure that another diagram jumps
in and reconciles energy conservation.
That's at least my way of looking into it,
but it's maybe my personal interpretation
of how all these diagrams and photon scattering
events work together.
