I like the beam splitter because the beam splitter
provides an exact formulation of the measurement process.
You really can use the beam splitter
to discuss what happens fundamentally
when you perform a measurement.
And the beam splitter is one typical implementation of that,
but it has all the features you will
find in any measurement system.

And especially what you observe here--
let me just emphasize this--
the fact that we do not make a measurement
is changing the wave function from the initial wave function
psi to psi 0.
We have a factor cosine theta here.
And that's also very general.
A measurement perturbs, modifies your wave function
no matter what the outcome of the measurement is.

OK.
So let me write it down, because we want
to take it to the next level.
So we have now found, in terms of the beam splitter, angle
theta and the parameters of the initial state, alpha beta.
We found the density matrix after the beam splitter.

OK, so what is the next step?
Our goal is to derive the master equation
for the density matrix, the time evolution of the density
matrix.
So since we want to discuss the time evolution,
we want to find a differential equation.
So what we want to figure out is what
is the difference between the output density matrix
and the input density matrix.
The input was, of course, a pure state
characterized by the matrix population alpha squared
and beta squared and of diagonal matrix element of alpha beta.
The difference between the density matrix is--
can just calculate the difference.
You can simplify things by applying
some trigonometric identities.
So this is an exact result, cosine theta minus 1.
Here we have alpha beta, cosine theta minus 1
and on the diagonal, we have cosine
2 theta minus 1 divided by 2.
Anyway, this is an intermediate result.
