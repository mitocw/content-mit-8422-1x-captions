But once we have realized that, we
can now immediately take this idea
and get the phase gate between two ions,
because the center of mass vibration is everywhere.
So therefore, what we can do is, this was ion one.

We can now, and this is the missing step
I want to show you, we can go to ion two, and we can--
we can swap the qubit information, ground, excited,
spin up, spin down, we can swap that
with the center of mass motion.
So therefore, what we can do is, when the second ion is spin up,
we do a print and we do a swapping of the information
from spin up, spin down, to center of mass motion
being 0 or 1.
So the idea is the following, ion two
should control what ion one is doing.
So we first focus on ion two.
We swap the quin of the qubit of ion two,
into the center of mass motion.
Then, we do what I just said, the controlled phase
gate, for ion one, with the center of mass motion.
And after this is done, we write the center of mass motion back
into ion two, and then we have nothing to ion two,
ion two was just putting its information
into the center of mass motion.
It helped ion one to do the controlled phase gate.
And then we swap that information back.
So this is a sequence.
After preparing the center of mass,
we first have to laser cool everything
into the, in the center of mass motion, into this zero state.
Then we swap from ion two, the information
to these four known states, and of mass vibration.
Then we do the controlled phase gate on ion one,
and then we swap the information gate.
The only-- so what I should show you, you may have seen it,
but what I should show you explicitly,
how do we swap the information GE you
from the internal state of ion two.
How do we write this information into the database, which
is the photon, which is the center
of mass vibration in the trap.
Well, we again use a red detuned [? side ?] pulse.
We do a pi pulse, driving this transition.
And just look how beautifully the math works out.
We have an arbitrary qubit state with superposition
of calmed and excited.
And the center of mass motion was laser
cooled to the ground state.
So let me just multiply that out.
So we have co-efficient eight time G0, plus coefficient B
times E0.
If we now do a pi pulse, we transfer the info maybe--
transfer the population from E-node into G1,
and this is what I've done here.
But now you see I can factor out the G, and what I have now is,
I have the same qubit information with coefficients
a and b, but no longer in the internal state of the ion,
but in the photon on state in the qubit, which
is the center of mass motion.
So the idea here is you can have an arbitrary number of ions.
And now, you want to have a quantum gate.
What you do with the quantum gate,
you say, I want to now take this ion here and have a quantum
gate with 10 ions further down.
So you first go to your first ion,
transfer the information of this qubit into the database,
into the center of mass motion.
And now, with the local operation
here, you can do something to this ion,
conditionally, on the motion-- the center of mass motion,
but the center of mass motion reflects the ion over there,
in which state it was.
And after you have done the two qubit operations
between those two q ions, you take
the center of mass motion, put it back into this ion,
and at the end of the day what you have done
is, you have done a two qubit operation.
You've changed the state of this ion, but all the other ions.
Have remained the same.
And with that, you can now, in a chain of ion,
implement arbitrary two qubit operations.

I think I said it clearer in words,
here it is in a little bit more formal way, the steps you
will do to the wave function.
You initialize, you transfer the information to the database,
you execute the controlled phase gate,
and you put the information from the database
back into the control ion.
And now your database is free.
It's back again to the initial value,
and ready for the next operation.
I should mention that this was a pioneering paper.

Right now this quantum gate is not the most popular one
because it has severe requirements.
One is you really have to cool to the absolute ground state.
The center of mass motion has to be
cooled to the absolute state.
There are other quantum gates which do not
require such extreme cooling.
And secondly, the center of mass motion, because all particles
move together, is the slowest--
it's one of the slowest vibration
and motions in the system.
And if you want to scale up the system to more particle,
the speed of the gate operation has
to be slower than the vibration appeared
of the center of mass motion.
So these are two disadvantages, but there
are different gates like geometric gates,
like Sorenson gates.
There are other possibilities to involve the same quantum
logic with ion, but the one of Cirac-Zoller, really
stands out by its pedagogy.
It's really a wonderful way to see
how we take that information, put it in a database,
do a controlled-- and controlled phase operation,
and then proceed to the next two qubit gate.
