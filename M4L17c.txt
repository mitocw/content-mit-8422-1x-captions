The next big chapter, namely we want
to understand the dipole forces within the dressed atom
picture.
The book Atom-Photon Interactions
has a nice summary of it, but the more detailed picture,
and I heavily draw from this, is in truly seminal article
by Jean Dalibard and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji.
I've linked this article to our website.

I've summarized here are pretty much what I just told you.
This is sort of the summary from the previous section.
What we have to know is, to understand light forces
in the dressed atom picture, is number one,
the energy splitting between the two.
The splitting between the two is the generalized Rabi frequency.
If there is anything which is not,
well I shouldn't say 100%, but at least 90% clear to you,
ask me a question.
These are the results we really need
for the following discussion.
So number one is the dressed energy
levels are split by the generalized Rabi frequency.
Number two is with this angle theta, which
came from the solution of diagonalizing the 2 by 2
matrix, we have now the steady state populations in the upper
and in the lower dressed state.
And the third thing is when we are not in steady state,
then the steady state populations
are obtained with a time constant, which is given here.
The time constant is, not just gamma,
it's gamma times these trigonometry functions.
So these are simple ingredients, but by using those ingredients
we can get a very nice formulation
for the stimulated force.
