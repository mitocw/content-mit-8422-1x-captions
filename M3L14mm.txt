The way how we solve this master equation in this limiting case
is by the method of adiabatic elimination of coherences.
And let me explain it to you with that equation.
What we have here is that the derivative of the coherences.
And when you look at the right hand side,
the derivative of the coherences is
kappa in damping terms times the coherence.
Well, if you have an equation which
says a dot equals minus strong damping times a,
you have a very rapid exponential damping.

The system immediately gets into an equilibrium,
and the equilibrium is given by the first term.
So if we have a situation that the population do not rapidly
change, then this equation can be
written that we have a very rapid damping.
And ultimately the coherences settle
to an quasi-equilibrium value in a time 1
over kappa, which is given by the first term.
In other words, you set the time derivative of the left hand
side 0, and then the coherences are
expressed in terms of the slowly changing quantity, which
are the populations.
So let me repeat, if coherences are rapidly damped,
we can neglect the time derivative of the left hand
side.
And at any given moment, the coherences
will be given by an expression which involves a population.
And if the populations slowly change,
the coherences will slowly change.
Or in other words, the coherences
follow the population, and the lag time is at most 1
over kappa, and we are in the limit of strong kappa.
This principle of eliminating coherences,
and we simply get a master equation for population,
is called the adiabatic elimination of coherences.
It's also called by Eric Hawken in his famous work
about synergy by the principle that if you have rapidly
damped modes, they are slaved by this slow modes.
In other words, the rapidly damped degrees of freedom
follow the slow degrees of freedom.
And this is what I just said, that the instantaneous value
of the coherence is is always given by the population.
So let me just write that down and see where it takes us.
So we have the situation that we want to now look
at the case of strong damping.
This is the overdamped case.
And we use now the method of adiabatic elimination
of coherences, because they are rapidly damped.
And there is a wonderful discussion about this method
in Atom-Photon Interaction.
It's the exercise 18 on page 601.
So mathematically what we assume is
that the population very slowly, for instance they
vary at the Rabi frequency.

So therefore, we can say that over the rapid time
evolution of the coherences--
rho 1 2 plus rho 2 1.
So this is a rapid time evolution of the coherences,
but for this, for times, which are on the order of 1
over kappa, the population are not changing.
The population change over the much longer time
scale, which is the period of the Rabi oscillation.
So therefore, for the short time scale,
I can sort of pretend that this term is constant.
And for obvious reasons, let me now call this constant term,
or slowly varying term, it is, at least for a short time
scales, the equilibrium value.
So the way we should read it is that the coherences
will very, very rapidly damp to this equilibrium value.
And this equilibrium some value was
given by the population, which may slowly change.
But that means now, by eliminating coherences,
we obtain a rate equation for the populations only.
So therefore, if you neglect short transience
over the short term 1 over kappa,
the coherences are always given by
this quasi-equilibrium value, which
is expressed by the population.
And therefore we can go to our master equation, which
was a master equation of diagram matrix elements of the density
matrix.
And we can now replace the coherences
by an expression which involves only population.
So we get now closed equations for only the population.
I'm sort of emphasizing that, because you may have asked
yourself when you have the rate equation a la Einstein
with the a and b coefficient.
These are just rate equation for populations.
But here in our class, we've always
talked about that density matrix,
how important the coherences are.
The coherences are important.
Without coherences, you would never absorb or emit light,
but if the coherences can be expressed by populations,
you don't need a differential equation for them.
OK, so with that now, we have one master equation
for the population.
And by just inserting that, we find this.
And we were interested in the decay of rho 1 1,
or this is also the population of the atom in the excited
state.
If we initially start where rho 1 1 is large,
we're interested in the initial decay,
then the population in the ground state is small.
And we find indeed that there is exponential decay
of the initial distribution.
And the decay rate, gamma z, gamma cavity,
is given by this expression.
So therefore, what we find is, but you know it
by now, the effect that the stronger we damp the cavity,
the smaller, the weaker is the decay of the initial state.
And I've already explained to you
that one picture to explain that is
that we have the excited state.
We have the ground state.
The ground state gets damped by kappa,
and therefore, time evolution which
