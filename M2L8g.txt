So just to repeat it, when we draw those diagrams,
those diagrams show the energy of the atom
but taking into account the energy of the photon.
In other words, if you have a ground state
and we absorb a photon, the photon has disappeared
and the energy of the atom is now the ground state
and the photon energy.
And this is a dashed line.
Similarly, when an atom emits a photon in the ground state,
the photon is emitted.
Therefore, the atomic energy is lower than the ground state
by the photon energy and we draw the dashed line here.
This is what we mean when we say that is
the energy of the virtual state and this is
what we draw in those diagrams.

By the way, yesterday we had the COA seminar
and the speaker was actually talking about trapping atoms
with quantum fluctuations.
And he considered explicitly Casimir forces,
forces of the vacuum, and diagrammatically,
forces of the vacuum come because a ground state
atom emits a virtual photon and re-absorbs.
This is actually--
I will mention it later--
the same diagram is actually also
the diagram which leads to the Lamb shift.
These are all sort of when you have atoms in the lowest state
and they interact with electromagnetic field,
well if they interact with a vacuum,
they cannot accept photon.
Doing All they can do is emit a photon and this
leads to this diagram.
But just to tell you that you have to be careful,
yesterday's speakers actually used this process
but he drew this diagram.
He drew it in the opposite way.
Which I think confused some people in the audience.
The correct way is to draw it like this,
the virtual state for vacuum fluctuations
for the Lamb shift for the Casimir force
is below the calm state.
Let me just redraw those three diagrams.
I want to now introduce the time evolution.
So we want to introduce the time axis.
So we had this diagram, we had this diagram, and we had--
this is a virtual state.
So those three diagrams correspond
to the following situation.
If time evolves from the bottom to the top,
we can know draw the first process
when atom in the ground state first absorbs and then emits
a photon.
And let's label the second photon in the purple color.
So an atom starts out in the ground state.
Then it reaches the time where it interacts
with the electromagnetic field.
There is a photon which propagates from earlier times
to this time, t equals t prime.
At the time t prime, the photon disappears
and the atom which was in the ground state
goes to the excited state.
It may propagate in the excited state for a while.
And then it emits the photon and is back into the ground state.
So this is the temporal diagram for this process.
For the next situation, we also start with an atom
in the ground state.
But now we have the situation that a photon
is emitted by the ground state.
As a result, .
The atom switches to the excited state
strong violation of energy, but possible for short times.
Then there is a real photon which
is now absorbed, absorbed by an atom in the excited state.
And that takes us back down to the ground state.
And finally in the third scenario,
we have an atom in the excited state.
There is a real photon which is absorbed that switches the atom
home into the ground state.
And then the atom in the ground state emits a photon
and as a result, it is back in the excited state.
So, let me just make a note that when a ground state
atom absorbs a photon, this is the co-rotating term
in the quantum description, which a lot of you have seen.
The opposite process of emitting a virtual photon--
actually when I say virtual photon, it's a photon.
What makes it virtual, we'll see later
when we have the more accurate mathematical formulation.
So, this is the counter-rotating term.
And we have used the rule that every photon--
which whether real or virtual--
every photon which is interchanged with the atom
absorbs or emitted changes the atomic state from ground
to excited.
So an atom goes from the ground to the excited state
either by photon absorption or by photon emission.
Both is possible.
So whenever photon appears or disappears, it changes.
Let's say we start in the ground state,
we go to the excited state.
And this is possible by photon absorption.
This is a co-rotating term or emission.
What I've just said reflects that when
we derived the dipole approximation,
that the essential term of the dipole operator is [INAUDIBLE].
The dipole operator is an operator between ground
and excited state.
Therefore, it has those two matrix elements
where as the electric field operator
is the creation and annihilation operator E and E [INAUDIBLE].
Or which is very elegant if I use for the two level system,
I spin one half description and I use sigma plus and sigma
minus, raising and lowering operator.
Sigma plus takes the ground state to the excited state.
Sigma minus takes exciting state to the ground state.
Then in the fundamental atom light interaction,
we have those four terms.
And now you see that sigma plus takes the atom from the ground
to the excited state.
But sigma plus appears both with photon absorption
and with photon emission.
So therefore, the atom can--
this is what the quantum mechanical operator
tells us-- go from the ground to the excited state
either by photon absorption or by photon emission.
