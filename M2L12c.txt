By looking at this formally, exact calculation,
we see the difficult part are those where we have this energy
denominator, which vanishes.
The other parts are simple.
They don't have any divergences, they
are not resonant, and such.
So what we want to do is now, in some way
we're going to give special treatment--
factor out the problematic terms and the rest is easy.
And for the easy part, which has no divergence,
we can make any kind of approximation
we want without ordering the physics.
But the resonant part, this needs
need special attention because if I take it
literally in those expressions they
don't make sense mathematically, because they cause infinities.
I could continue to do it completely algebraically,
but because of--
I think it's just beautiful method.
I want to look at this equation and divide it
down in some bits.
We want to arrive at a diagrammatic representation
for this matrix element of resolving Gbb,
and I use symbols where the circle means the interaction.
The straight line stands for the term which is problematic,
which has the resonant interaction,
has the divergent denominator.
And then I use a dashed line for all other terms,
all other intermediate states, where i is not b and therefore
there is not a problem.
It's not.
Resonant We don't have a divergence.
You see the structure of the sum.

We propagate here, we make a transition from l to k,
and then we propagate here.
So in this kind of order you start in this state,
you have a vertex, you go to the other state, you have a vertex,
you go to the next state, you have a vertex.
This is how the system works.
This is what quantum mechanics does for you.
And what you're going to do is, this is not algebraic equation.
And now you want to order them in the following way.
We want to figure out which of those expressions
can include this problematic term exactly twice,
or three times, or four times.
So when you regroup those infinite sums,
this algebraic terms in such a way that we say OK,
which one has the occurrence of this once, twice, three times,
four times.
So we regroup the terms and then we see what we can do.
Now I've picked the matrix element Gbb
so that means over here, and over here, we
start out in the state b.
So if I write down all terms which
contain this lesson in term twice,
well, we start with the resonant term.
And we have to end with a resonant term
because we have the matrix element Gbb,
which I'm focusing now on.
And so there can be one vertex.
We can start with this term and now we
can do something else in between.
But we are not allowed to go back to the state
b because we are only looking at terms with a solid line appears
twice.
So therefore, this can only be a dashed line--
another state.
We can go through two vertices but it can only include
dashed lines in between.
So let me use another symbol for it.
So we start with that state.
We end with a state b.
But in between, we can sort of once, twice, three times,
go through other intermediate states.
But we never are allowed to create another divergence.
And this infinite sum over all other states,
I don't know how to calculate it yet,
but I just call it a square box.
So in other words, what is sort of in lowest
order of the operator V with these other infinite terms,
I symbolize that kind of much more complicated vertex,
which includes an infinite sum by a square
and not by a circle.
So diagrammatically-- feel free to write it down
mathematically.
It's obvious how to do it.
The square box is the circle plus all terms like this.
Let's go back to form two equations.
We call this the function Rb of z.
And what I've shown in diagrams above
is nothing else than the circle Vbb, the matrix element
of the interaction.
But now we have sums where we're not
allowed to go through the resonant state.
We have to go from b to intermediate state.
We propagate in the intermediate state.
And then we have to go back and it's clear
how to go to higher terms.
So we've just defined this function R
by focusing on two occurrences of the straight line.
Well, let's look at higher order terms.
What happens when z minus eb, the divergent term,
comes to the power n?
Well, we just dealt with any n equals 2.
let's now look at n equals three.
Colin.
I'm trying to find the definition again.
Is the box a t-matrix or an s-matrix?
What's definition of the two of them?
The s is--
I don't know.
I don't know the currency.
The t-matrix is actually the matrix, the relevant matrix
of the time evolution operator.
And if you factor out the delta function for the energy shall,
you get the s-matrix.
But we're not talking about the kind of evolution operator
here, we're talking about the full way transform.
And we are looking at the resolvent, which
is the function G, and now we've introduced the function R.
I actually tried to look up--
I wanted you to use the correct word in class.
I couldn't find the name.
In the book it's just called the function R,
so it's the function R And the function turns out
with the kernel of the resolvent G. But none of it
is the s-matrix and t-matrix.
It is related, because if you do the inverse Fourier transform
from G, you recall back to U, and then we have,
I would say, the t-matric.
Isn't their sum an issue?
You will find that it has real and imagined,
or has real and imaginary.
Part one is itself energy, and the other one
is a decayed rate.
It has an imaginary part.
But the real part will be itself energy.
yes We connect a lot of passwords
you may have heard here and there.
OK.
The question is, do we have to now define
pentagons and hexagons?
Do we have to find more and more symbols
for more and more complicated sums?
But the nice thing is, no.
Because n equals 3, means we really
have to start in state b.
We have to stand in state b.
And one time in the time evolution
we can go through state b.
And now between that we can go from here to there
with any combination of states you want.
But one thing is not allowed--
to involve the state b.
Because we are focusing on three occurrences of the state
b, and every thing else other than the state b,
has already a symbol.
It is just square symbol.
So this is the exact representation for n equals 3.
And the contribution to the resolvent, G,
the Fourier transform of the time evolution operator
is well, we have factored out three occurrences of the state
b.
And then we have three occurrences of this state b.
We need two square boxes, but the square boxes
already in name and the algebraic definition.
So this is nothing else than, I think it's
called the kernel rb squared.

OK.
I've shown you n equals 2.
I've shown you n equals 3.
I assume it's now absolutely clear how to continue.
It just involves more and more power.
So the lowest order is that, and whenever
we ask what happens when we allow
more appearances of this state b for each of them,
we obtain another square box.
So, by looking at the terms which are bothersome
and regrouping the infinite terms according
to one occurrence, two occurrence, three occurrence
of these divergent denominator.
We have now found an exact expression for Gb of z.
And since this is now an algebraic equation
with n geometric series, we can write it exactly
as this minus Rb of z.
