We have this function R in the real and imaginary part, which
depends on the energy E. But remember
we work so hard with diagrams to make sure
that the triangle, first the square and then the triangle,
and this is what we calculate here,
has no resonant structure at the E b.
So therefore, we can neglect the energy dependence of that
and simply replace the argument E by the energy
we're interested in, namely energies close to E b.
So in other words, when we had the function,
the resolve in G b of Z, all the dependence on energy
came from this kernel.
But this kernel is now so well-behaved, there
are no resonant terms, that we can neglect its energy
dependence.
This actually has a name which we will encounter later
when we discuss master equation and Optical Bloch equations.
So this, neglect E and replace the dependence by E
by taking the value at E b, this corresponds
to the Markov approximation.
The Markov approximation often means
that some relaxation time or some response of a system
is replaced by delta function.
Well, we've done the same here, because if you
keep if you replace some temporal response
function by a delta function, that
means the Fourier transform becomes constant.
And by neglecting the energy dependence,
we are now seeing everything is constant as a function
of energy, and that means in the temporal mean
that we have a delta function.
I don't want to go further here, but when
we talk about the master equation
we will also make a Markov approximation
later on, but then in the temporal domain.
And the two are equivalent here.
So what we've got now is we found
a solution for the Fourier transform of the time evolution
operator, which initially had a divergence at Energy b,
and this was the problem we are facing,
but by now calculating the function R,
we have a correction, which is a radiative shift, which
comes from the real part, and we obtained,
as promised, the imaginary part, which
we can approximate by Fermi's Golden Rule.
If we now Fourier transform back and obtain the time
evolution of this state, it no longer
evolves with the energy E b, it has shifted energy
by the self energy, and this is called the radiative shift.
But in addition, because of the imaginary part,
it has now an exponential decay.
You should know, and this is what you may have expected,
but there are two things you should learn:
the first thing is that the exponential decay
would be different if we had not made the Markov approximation.
If we had kept a dependence of this imaginary part on energy,
the Fourier transform would not have simply
given us an exponential.
So therefore the exponential decay
involves an approximation that the R function
has no energy dependence.
And you would say, well, is that really possible?
If you have an atom, and it decays,
or you have the atom in state B, at very, very short times,
you need Fourier transform elements
of large amounts of energy.
So maybe for the first femtosecond
for the time evolution of an excited state,
you need whatever, in whole x-ray spectrum of energies.
And it's obvious that the properties of this expression,
where you sum over all states, something
will happen when you go past the normal excitation
energy or the ionoization energy of the atom.
So what you can immediately read from here
is that exponential decay is a simple approximation.
It works very well, but at very early times,
it will break down, because then the energy dependence matters.
But the longer you wait, if you wait a few nanoseconds,
the relevant part of the Fourier transform
is only a small energy or frequency
interval around the resonance energy,
and then the density of states of your photon field
is pretty much constant around here,
and then this approximation is excellent.
So I hope what you have learned from that treatment is,
number one, where the exponential decay comes from.
Of course you know that from coupling
two modes, but that the approximation which
leads to exponential decay also involves
that the density of states and the density of modes
is constant, which is excellent for certain times,
but which is of course violated at earlier times.
And finally, if we hadn't done the infinite summation
of diagrams, if we had done a perturbative expansion,
he would have never obtained exponential decay.

We've obtained some polynomial decay.
Questions about that?

Yes.
What is the polynomial decay?

Some power law.

As far as I know, it would just involve powers of n.
If you do lowest order perturbation theory,
instead of getting an exponential decay,
you would just get a linear slope.
That's perturbation theory.
And if you fix it, I think you get quadratic terms,
so it's a sum of power loss.

Of course, the exponential function
has a Taylor expansion, which is an infinite sum
of polynomial terms, and therefore we
need infinite order to get the exponential.
So it's not really profound, what I'm saying,
it's pretty much an exponential function is nonperturbative.
Other questions?
