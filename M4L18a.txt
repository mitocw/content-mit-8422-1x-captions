Today I want to finish our discussion on magnetic traps
with two demonstrations of classical forms
of magnetic trapping.
But I told you that magnetic trapping is a purely
classical phenomenon.
The only mechanical aspect is that this angle
at which the magnetic dipole is always in the magnetic field
is quantized.
I also mentioned to you, and this was Wing's Theorem,
that the total magnetic field can have only local minima, not
maxima.
And therefore, we can do magnetic trapping only
for weak field sinking states.
These are states, which lower their energy
with-- for low magnetic fields.
And as a result, since the spin is up,
the magnetic moment is interparallel
to the magnetic field.
Those states can always lower their energy
by flipping the spin.
I know it's a simple demonstration,
but well, I can't bring a real magnetic trap
into the classroom.
So what I have here is just two little ring magnets,
refrigerator magnets.
And there is a tube, so I just want
to demonstrate a one dimensional form of magnetic trapping
to you.
And this is our atom, it's a strong magnet elongated
and it can be spin up or it can be spin down.
So what you're seeing is now, you're seeing the two magnets.
And you're seeing our dipole, our atom,
which is in a stable trapping configuration.

You can see that it's stable by, you know, I just move it
and you see how it always comes back.
So that's one position.
I put it over, here, you have a second position,
where our magnet is trapped.
Here is a third one.
And here's a fourth one.
So there are four positions where we
have one dimensional trapping.
Well, this is one for one orientation.
Now I take the magnet and flip it over.
So we are changing now, in the laboratory frame, the sign
of the magnetic moment.
And there is actually a very nice minimum,
you see how clearly it is trapped.
There is one here in the middle.
I can also just show you, it really stays put.
There's a weak restoring force.
And then here is number three.
So it seems fairly very rich, I've
shown you seven different minima where trapping has happened.
And well, just to fill you in, if this is our magnet,
these are ring magnets.
The magnetic field is about-- is something like that.
And if I plot the magnetic field for this configuration,
I find indeed that for one orientation,
there are four maxima of the magnetic field.
And for this orientation, and there are four,
there are four minima of the trapping potential.
But so maybe I should have shown it like this.
There are 1, 2, 3, 4 minima.
And for the opposite configuration, the blue--
for the opposite configuration, there
are 1, 2, 3 trapping minima.
But now if you look, there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
the one's marked in red, which are for strong field seekers
because these are maxima at the magnetic field.
And there is only one where the magnetic field
is a local minimum.
So in the last part, I have shown you the absolute value
of the magnetic field.
And you realize there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 maxima.
And this is responsible for six trapping configurations.
And the seventh one was the minimum of the magnetic field.
So in one dimension there is no problem.
In one dimension I can get a restoring force for the strong
and for the weak field seeker.
For any orientation of the magnetic dipole, but if you
want to have a freedom [INAUDIBLE] trap,
we have to look at the three dimensional stability.
And it would be only this one configuration, which
can be stabilized in x and y.
What I've shown you are symmetric fields
so all these minima and maxima are only settle points,
they trap in one dimension.
But with suitable radial magnetic field,
you could turn this one here into a real three
dimensional trap.
But the other ones, you cannot.
Because this would violate Wings theorem.

I find it amazing that, you know,
that this demonstration has seven
different magnetic configurations.
It's just how it turns out to be.
Questions?
Collin.
So if you look at the cloverleaf coil, the parts of the field
that--
this is sort of [INAUDIBLE]?

Yeah, so if you look at a cloverleaf trap,
the pinched coils creates such a minimum
which provides confinement in this E direction.
But then you add a field radially
outward quadrupole field, and that overcomes--
no, in this demonstration this is actually
everything is [INAUDIBLE].
So this is a minimum for this direction,
but if you would now plot it as a function of x and y and z,
it would be a settle point.
So this configuration is trapping along z,
but n type trapping along x and y.
But if you add a quadrupole field, a linear field which
points outward with these cloverleafs or the [INAUDIBLE],
then they would provide confinement
which is stronger than the entire confinement
of the center point.
If you look at some equations I showed you in the last class,
you will actually see that in one of the slides
I had the expression for the magnetic field where
you see how the [INAUDIBLE], the radially linear confinement
over [INAUDIBLE] comes the anti- trapping, the anti trapping
feature of the settle point.
Other question?
