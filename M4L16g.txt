Now, we are going to have a quick look at those two forces.
So therefore I'm now discussing the two simpler but already
very characteristic cases for those forces.
One is we want to look at a plane traveling wave.
And then we want to look a pure standing we've.
And the beauty of it is in the plane traveling wave,
you have a plane wave.
The amplitude of the electric field is constant everywhere.
It just oscillates.
And therefore, this alpha vector is 0.
And in a few minutes, we look at the standing wave.
And in the standing wave, the beta vector is 0.
So the traveling wave and the standing wave
allows us now to look at the two forces
separately, in two physical situations which
are as you will see later, highly
relevant for experiments.
Well, I don't think I have to tell anybody
in this room, maybe except some people who
take the course for breadth requirement,
that standing waves are optical lattices are common in all x.
And similar, traveling wave beams
are used for instance for decelerating atomic beams.
So we illustrate the two forces now.
But we are really discussing two experimentally very important
geometries.
OK, plane traveling wave.
I mean, I'm just really, plug now--
the electromagnetic field for plane traveling wave,
I plug it into the equations above.
The important thing is, and which simplifies things a lot,
is that the alpha vector is 0, the amplitude of the plane wave
is, that's where the plane wave is constant.
And the beta vector is the gradient
of the frequency is just the k vector of the light.
So therefore, the dissipative or spontaneous light force
was the [INAUDIBLE] frequency times the v component
of the optical block vector times h bar k.
And this has a very simple interpretation
because the steady state solution of the optical block
equation is nothing else than gamma times the excited state
population.
And since the excited state scatters or emits
photons at the rate gamma, this is nothing else
than the number of--
well, absorbed emitted scattered photons times h bar k.
We are in steady state here, so the number
of photons, which are emitted into all space into the vacuum
has to be the number of photons, which has been
absorbed from the laser beam.
So therefore, the interpretation here is very simple.
You have a laser beam.
Every time the atom absorbs have photon, it receives
a recoil transfer h bar k.
Now afterwards, the photon is scattered.
But this scattering is symmetric and does not
impart the force onto the atom.
And this is what we discussed earlier.
The quantum part of the electromagnetic field
is symmetric.
And here you see sort of what it means visually.
Spontaneous emission goes equally
probable in opposite direction and there is no net force.
But there is heating as we discuss later.
So we can plug-in the solution, the steady state
solution from the optical block equation.
That's our lorentzian.
We have discussed power broadening already
when we discussed the Optical Bloch Equation.
And of course, I just remind you,
that if you separate the system with a strong laser power, what
you can obtain is that half of the population
is in the excited state and half of the population
is in the ground state.
Under no circumstances do you get the maximum force.
And the maximum spontaneous force
is the momentum per photon times the maximum rate
at which a 2-level atom can scatter photons.

So that's in a nutshell.
I think all you have to know about the spontaneous light
force as far as the force is concerned.
But we still have to discuss the heating associated
with this spontaneous force, which are the force
fluctuations Questions?
