So I've explained to you the dissipative force,
the active force.
And in the next unit, I want to show you, simply, applications
of the spontaneous force.
In every experiment on cold atoms,
the spontaneous force is center stage.
It is necessary to slow down atomic beams.
It provides molasses, which is a cooling of atoms
to micro-Kelvin temperature.
And the spontaneous force is also
responsible for the magneto optic trap.
So what I want to do here is, again,
by showing you the relevant equations, how
the spontaneous force, which we have just discussed,
how this spontaneous force leads to those three applications.
So this is one of the most experimental sections
of this course, because this equation has it all in it.
And I just want to show you how this equation can
be applied to three different important experimental
geometries.
OK.
So this is our equation.
It has the momentum transfer per photon.
It has the maximum scatter rate gamma over 2.
And then, here, it has the Lorentzian line shape.
And the important thing is, when we talk about molasses and beam
slowing, is that the detuning is the laser detuning
and the Doppler detuning.
So the velocity dependence enters now
the spontaneous force through the detuning in the Lorentzian
denominator.
And it enters through the Doppler effect.
So you can pretty much say it like this.
If you have a bunch of laser beam
and slow and cool your atoms, how can the lasers do the job?
Well, we measure the velocity of the atoms with the Doppler
shift.
And it is the Doppler shift which
tells the laser beams what to do, so to speak.
And this is how laser cooling works.
So just as an experimentalist, you should actually
know what the scale is.
If somebody asks you, how strong is the spontaneous scattering
force?
Well, way to connect it with real-time unit--
with real-life units is--
what is the maximum deceleration?
Well, this is 10 to the 5G.
You can ask, is 10 to the 5G a lot, or not?
Well, for an astronaut, it would be a lot.
No living organism can sustain 10 to the 5G.
But I'm really surprised.
When I did this calculation, when you compare it
to the electric force on an ionized atom,
the same force which is provided by the spontaneous light force
would be provided by an electric field of one
millivolt per centimeter.
So it's not easy, if you have a stainless steel chamber,
to avoid [? patch ?] effects which
create those electric fields.
And if you had a battery with nine volt a centimeter apart,
just a 9-volt battery, it would accelerate an ion four orders
of magnitude faster than your beloved, strong, spontaneous
light force.
So in that sense, 10 to the 5G is
a lot in the macroscopic world.
But if you would look at microscopic forces, which
are often electric forces, it's absolutely tiny.
And sometimes, I say, the fact that you
can do 100 killivolt per centimeter,
that you can make electric forces which are seven, eight,
or nine orders of magnitude stronger,
that's actually the reason why ion traps
were invented before trapping of neutral particles.
So some developments in the field
of trapping particles and eventually laser cooling them,
it first started with ion traps.
And then, it proceeded to neutral atoms.
And the reason is the ion trappers
have forces at their disposal which are eight or nine
orders of magnitude stronger.
