And my question for you is A, B, and C,
whether the decay rate copper is proportional
to the damping rate gamma, proportional to the inverse
of gamma, or independent of gamma.

So we've [INAUDIBLE] this system.
The system has possibility of Rabi oscillation.
I showed you the damp Rabi oscillation and in the limit
of small copper.
But now you go to the overdamped regime and my question is,
if the system is overdamped, will this decay of [? 8 ?]
increase with gamma, increase with copper,
decrease with copper, or will it be
independent in the overdamped regime?
