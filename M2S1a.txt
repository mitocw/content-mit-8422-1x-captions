In the following video, you will see the derivation
of the full QED Hamiltonian.
The full QED Hamiltonian is very important for this course,
because it describes all aspects of the interaction of light
with atoms.
Now, if you're not interested in the details of the derivation,
the result is very, very simple, as is shown here.
We simply have the free particle Hamiltonian momentum
squared over 2 m, and the presence
of electromagnetic modes--
the presence of light--
modifies this Hamiltonian.
We add the vector potential to the momentum.
P minus q A becomes the canonical momentum,
and we have to add the Hamiltonian for the radiation
field, which is simply a summation over all modes
of the electromagnetic field.
And each mode is an harmonic oscillator.
So that's it.
This is how atoms interact with light.
I recommend to you to look at the full derivation,
because it provides a very good background
to all the assumptions and all the steps which
lead to those terms.
For instance, you may wonders there
is an electric field which is a coulomb field,
but there's also an electric field
which is part of radiation.
How do we distinguish between the two?
Well, the answer is, one is the transverse field
and one is the longitudinal field.
Or you may wonder how all the different modes come into play.
Well, the modes of the electromagnetic field
is part of the classical solution.
And as you will see in the longer video, when
we look at the electromagnetic field classically,
we can transform the equation that in the end
Maxwell's equations for the radiation field
reduce to harmonic oscillator equations, one for each mode.
So in other words, the full video
gives you a deeper familiarity and a deeper understanding
to all the concepts which lead to those simple equations.
So here is a summary of what will be derived in the video.
It is the Hamiltonian in its full beauty.
It has a vector potential, but of course, the important part
is how is the vector potential expressed
by quantum mechanical operators?
And we will see that the vector potential is expressed
in terms of a and a dagger--
creation and annihilation operators for photons.
And that's what atoms do--
they absorb and they emit photons.
And eventually, we have the Hamiltonian for light.
And as I mentioned earlier, by carefully modifying
Maxwell's equations, finding a Langrangian or Hamiltonian
formalism of classical electrodynamics,
we find that all the complicated radiation
fields can be decomposed into modes,
and each mode is simply an harmonic oscillator
