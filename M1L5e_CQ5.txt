OK, so now the next question is-- again,
just to make sure you have the same basis, what
is now the variance?
If I measure the fluctuating current-- I
measure the current, I have a coherent state,
and I repeatedly measure the current,
it will show fluctuations.
And the question is what is not the standard deviation
of the current, what is the variance, which is the standard deviation squared.
