You know in class I always try to teach you something
conceptional, and the conceptional part
I want to address now is, let's assume
we are on the right hand side, on the attractive side
of the Feshbach resonance.
Two atoms weakly attract each other
with the negative scattering links,
but there is no bound molecular state.
So how should you know understand
that if you have many fermions, that those fermions form
Cooper pairs and pairs.
And the question I would have for you is, you've definitely,
probably heard about it, is this pairing mechanism which
requires the [? fermi ?] C. Is that many-body pairing,
that somehow correlation between many particles is unnecessary,
and it's a genuine many-body effect,
or can you still understand Cooper pairing as mainly
a two body effect.

So in other words, how much many-body
is really involved in creating pairs
in the presence of a [? fermi C. ?]
Does anybody know the answer?

What do you hear for most people is that, it's
a real many-body effect.
Two particles cannot form a pair in vacuum,
so it is really many-body physics and you say, wow,
I really have to understand complicated physics.

[INAUDIBLE]
It has something to do with [? the fermi C. ?] What--
[? Tim? ?]
I may know the answer.
Maybe-- Maybe you like to--
Well, give it away!
There is always a ground state in two dimensions,
I think, between arbitrarily small fractions.
Fermi C helps you get the two dimensions.
That's great.
So what I want to show you is exactly what he just said.
You can really understand Cooper pairs,
you can understand the exponential dependence
on the scattering links by simply
looking at one particle, two particles,
with a very weak potential.
But you have to look at it in two dimension.
And it is eventually the Fermi C which
provides the two-dimensional density of states.
So in other words, the binding of Cooper
pairs, at least qualitatively, can
be understood-- understood with a single [? Particle ?]
Schrodinger equation with under cradled physics knowledge.
Colin?
I guess a picture that was, sort of when you think of BCS,
and a real solid, like a three-dimensional solid is that
one electron travelling through the lattice,
repels all of the electrons of similar spins
or poly-exclusion.
And then, the electron of another spin moving
with opposite momentum, sort of, sees
that as a deficit of that spin component.
Sort of attracted to that region.
So in that sense isn't sort of this effective clearing out
of other particles to make room for another one?
There's not many bodies associated with Fermi C?
Very good.
So we're talking about two different things here.
One is we need an attraction.
In the atomic system we get an attraction because of van der
Waals molecular forces.
That's it.
For electrons, which have Coulomb charge,
where is the attraction?
And you wonderfully described that there is
attraction between electrons.
It's like the couch effect.
If you sit on a couch, you indent the couch,
and the person next to you will move towards you.
Similarly, when an electron goes through a lattice,
it leaves the polarization of the lattice behind,
and the next electron is attracted to this trajectory.
So what you're explaining is full non-mediated process
which leads to attraction.
But if I have to fermions which attract each other,
I don't need this complication.
But couldn't you get it without a lattice
without-- just think like the Fermi gas.
If I had one fermion and I move it, the location that it was,
has been--
all the other Fermions have been pushed away
from that [INAUDIBLE].
So there's a sort of, a density depletion there.
So, couldn't another [? spin ?] component
see that as an effective [INAUDIBLE]?
I mean density depletion.
Density waves, and these are sound waves,
maybe there is a possibility to map it on photons in a lattice.
I haven't heard about it.
So I've never heard about such an attraction which
would happen in a Fermi gas which would give the Coulomb
propulsion for some correlation attractive component.
What is well described of course, is the couch model,
or the photon model, you mentioned.
But I'm saying, this is just giving you the attraction.
But the question is now, and that's
the next question I raised, once we
have an attraction between two particles,
do we need many-body physics or single particle
physics to have pairing.
So let me now address that.
Now this is out of the review paper.
You can read much more about it.
But it simply reminds you, undergraduate problem,
what happens when you have two particles with a very
weak attractive potential?
And of course since you can eliminate
the center of mass motion when I say two particles,
it's the same as one particle attracted
to a center potential.
And what you learn, or what you may have already learned
in your undergraduate days is, that in one D if you
have an infinitesimal dates of this [INAUDIBLE]
you found a bound state.
The bound state will decay very slowly, but it's a bound state.
In 2-Dimension, you also find a bound state.
And in two dimensions logarithm appears,
and often when logarithm appears,
it's sort of the limit.
The logarithm is the weakest form of binding,
and if you go one step further, for a very, very
small effective potential you do not have a bound state.
So in 3-dimension, you need a minimum,
you need a critical energy of the square well, critical dates
before your bound state, where its infinitesimal attraction
is enough to bind particles in one or two dimensions.
So therefore when we talk about fermions
with a very weak attraction, in 1-D and 2-D, no problem,
they can form pairs by that.
Pairs even in vacuum.
But in 3-D we need something else,
because an infinitesimal attraction is not
enough to form a pair.
Now let me ask you the following question, you all know--
that, let me just cover this slide
because it gives the solution.
You all know that in 3-Dimension when you have radial symmetry,
you can transform the 3-dimensional Schrodinger
equations into an angular equation,
but then also into a one dimensional equation
for the radial wave function.
And of course this one dimensional radial equation
has the same potential as the original three
dimensional equations.
So I don't know.
I want to hear from one of you, why
it does now an infinitesimal square well
potential with attraction gives bound states in 1-D,
but not in 3-D. Because in 3-D the radial wave
equation uses the same infinitesimal potential
as in 1-D. Jen?
Because you have to break down an effective potential that
takes into account the central Coulomb.
Perfect!
But let's use L equals zero.
Then the centrifugal potential is--
the centrifugal correction is zero.
Otherwise you are right, it's an effective potential.
But let's talk about L equals zero, S-states.
Then there is no connection to the--
do to the centrifugal forces.

Go ahead.
Radio derivative is no longer just
a simple second derivative, of sort of whatever--
No, no.
It is.
You have a more complicated radial derivative,
but then you go to an equation, which just says D- 2- D-
r squared over function U, and it's exactly
the one dimensional Schrodinger equation, which you write down.
You can transform the radial equation
with a more complicated derivative
into something which is exactly a 1-D Schrodinger equation.
Yes?
[INAUDIBLE]
Sure.
Uncertainty of relation always can immediately help you,
you have an uncertainty relation for kinetic energy
and you realize that you don't have enough potential.
But maybe mathematically what is different
between the identically looking 1-D Schrodinger
equation and the radial Schrodinger equation
for the wave function U.
I don't know how this is going to lead to it,
but I noticed one difference is that in the 3-Dimensional case
you can't go less than zero.
Exactly.
In the 3-dimensional case, you have a wave function psi,
but then do a substitution that 1-D Schrodinger equation,
it's not for psi it is for U, and to U
is the radial part divided by r.
So you transformed to a different function,
which is one more power or r.
And the requirement because of this
is that your radial wave function of this one
dimensional radial equation has to have a node in the center.
And now you see what happens, if you start at zero your wave
functions shoots up.
If you don't have enough attraction,
it will never curve down and become a normalizable state.
Whereas in 1-D, you do not have the requirement
that the wave function of your 1-D Schrodinger equation
is a node.
So you have same equation, the same infinitesimal potential,
but the--
but the radial equation has a different boundary condition.
So that's the difference.
And that's important, it the changes of physics completely.
OK.
Now it looks very different, and it seems you have to--
Nicky?
What about 2-D?
The limiting case, we come to that in a second.
