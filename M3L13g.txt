I really like the discussion-- the derivation of the master
equation-- how it is presented in Atom Photon Interactions.
But well, it is presented on more than 50 pages
with many, many equations.
So after giving you all the principles, all the concepts,
I want to go with you now over those equations
and point out how the principles which we encountered
with the beam splitter, how they are now implemented
in a very general context.
I will not be able to give you all the mathematical aspects
of it.
But I think by now you know that the book Atom Photon
Interactions is actually wonderful.
You can get a lot of conceptual information out of it
by looking at the equations without understanding
every technical detail.
So I would really encourage you if there is something which
piques your interest, and I hope there
will be things which you find very interesting, that you
go to the book and read it.
So I'm exactly following that.
We have an Hamiltonian, which is describing the atomic system.
It describes the reservoir.
And then there is an interaction.
We keep it very general here.
But you may always think, well, the atom is
your favorite two-level system.
The environment is maybe the vacuum
with all its possible modes.
And the interaction is the dipole interaction
or the a dot p interaction.
So we start out with an equation,
which is nothing else than Schrodinger's equation
for the density matrix.
The time derivation of the density matrix
is a commutator with the Hamiltonian.
But it is often useful, and you've seen it many times,
to go to the interaction representation--
that the time dependence due to the unperturbed part
of the operator is absorbed in a unitary transformation.
So therefore this density matrix in the interaction
representation evolves not with H, because H0 is taken care of.
It only involves due to the coupling between the two
systems, between the system and the environment.
So now this equation-- you're interested in a time step
delta-t.
And this time step delta-t, remember,
we want to core screen will be larger
than the correlation time of the reservoir.
And you will see exactly where it comes about.
So we want to now do one of those core screen steps.
We take this equation and we integrate from time-t
to time-t plus delta-t.

So this is exact here.
But now we want to iterate, and that means the following.
We have expressed the time step in the density matrix
by having the density matrix there.
But now we can do in a first order perturbation theory--
we can do one step.
And we get the second order resolved
by plugging the first order result into this equation.
It's the same we have seen with our diagrams and such.
We have an exact equation.
It's useless unless we do something.
And what we do is we realize that we can iterate it,
because the part we don't know involves one more occurrence
of the interaction potential.
And when you plug the dense order solution in here,
you get the n-plus first order solution.
And this is exactly what is done here.
And I skipped a few equations here.
This is what is done here, number one.
And number two is we're interested in the system,
not in the reservoir.
So therefore we perform the trace over the reservoir.
And the trace of the reservoir for the photon beam splitter
meant--
we say we have two possible-- two possible states.
We detect the photon or not.
And for the system, we have now a density matrix,
which is probability p0 in one state, probability
p1 in the other state.
And this is exactly what the operator partial trace does.
Remember also, I want to really make sure
that you recognize all the structures.
The time evolution of a density matrix was a commutator with H.
But in the interaction picture, it's
a commutator with V. Since we are putting the first order
result in here, the second order result is now the commutator
with--
of V with the commutator of V and O.
It's just we have iterated one more time.
So V sigma tilde, the density matrix for our system.
Tilde means in the interaction picture--
is now the partial trace over the reservoir
of the total density matrix.
Tilde means in the interaction picture.
And the important part here is that it is exact.
We have not done any approximation here.
Any questions?
Of course now we have to make approximations,
because we cannot solve an arbitrary quantum problem
exactly.
The first one is--
and what do we want to do in the end?
We want to keep the first non-trivial term.
But to the extent possible, we won't to factorize everything.
We want to get rid of the entanglement of the environment
and the system and only get the minimum which
is provided by the coupling.
So this evolves as follows.
The interaction we assume is a product of two operators.
One operator acts on the system.
One operator acts on the environment.
So this could be the dipole acting on the atom,
the vacuum filled E interacting with the environment,
or it could be p dot a.
Or maybe your system has a magnetic moment m,
and the environment is--
consists of fluctuating magnetic fields.
So we will pretty much find in every kind of measurement
that a measurement involves the product of two operators.
One is an operator for your system.
And one is an operator for the reservoir
or for the environment.

So this is one thing we want to use.
And now there is some-- one thing which--
the moment we will use set in our equations.
There is one thing which will naturally appear.
What we have here is the interaction operator V
at two different times.
So this means if something is-- happens at different times,
and we indicate over times.
This is a correlation function, a correlation function
between V at the time t-prime and the time t-double-prime.
And the reservoir part of this interaction is the operator r.
So what we have here now is we have a correlation
between the operator r at 2 times, which
characterizes the environment.
And now comes an important approximation.
You'll remember I said we want to assume
that the environment has a very short correlation time.
Whenever a photon is emitted, it appears dramatically fast.
It disappears in one optical cycle,
and the environment is sort of reset.
It's back in the vacuum state.
So this is now expressed here, that this product over which
we take the partial trace has a very short coherence time.
And the fact is now the following--
we are integrating over a coarse-grained step delta t.
But this correlation function goes to 0 in a very short time.
So therefore, it will not contribute a lot.
Let me write that down.
What we want to approximate is our total density matrix
is now approximately factorizing in a density matrix
describing the atomic system.
Well, we describe the atomic system
when we trace out the environment.
We describe the environment when we trace out the atomic part.
And if we now form the direct product,
we are back to the total system, but we
have factorized the total density matrix into two parts.
What we neglect here is a part which cannot be factorized,
which is the correlated part of it.

But what happens is, since we are integrating over time steps
delta t, and the correlations decay in a very,
very short time, the result is that this complicated part--
which we could never calculate--
is smaller than the first part by the ratio of the time
where the correlations contribute
over the time delta t, the times that we are going to take.
So this is a very critical assumption.
There is a whole page or two in the book
where in atom-photon interaction they discuss the validity
of this assumption.
But I've given you the physical motivation that we integrate
over much larger time.
And if this time is large, and the correlations
last for a short time, they only contribute
with this small parameter to the result.
So in other words, that means after we have--
we have an interaction between the environment and the system.
We write it down in second order.
But the second order result is now
evaluated by factorizing the density matrix into our system
and the reservoir.
So that means, in that sense, if you factorize something,
it looks as if it's non-interacting.
But the trick is the same.
You write down something to first and second order.
And once you have factored out the important physics,
now you can evaluate the expression
by using an approximation, which is now the approximation
that the density matrix factorizes.

So this is the approximation we have made--
that the correlation time is very short.
And now we have a differential equation
for the density matrix sigma, which
describes our atomic system.

We have traced out the decrease of the reservoir.

And now we want to insert B.17.
You probably don't remember what B.17 is.
It says that the interaction operator is the product of A,
the operator A for the atoms, and r for the reservoir.
So the reservoir part--
tau prime, tau double prime--
gives a correlation function.
This is the correlation function between the operator
r at two different times.
And the part which acts on our system,
the A part is explicitly kept here.
So this is now a general master equation.
It tells us the time evolution of the density matrix.
And in this form, it looks very complicated,
but this is because it's very general.
In order to bring it into an easier form,
we want to now introduce the basis of states, energy
eigenstates, of the unperturbed system,
and write down all these operators
into such a basis of states.
But anyway, you saw here how we had an exact equation.
And the main approximation we made
is that the operator acting on the environment
has a very short correlation time.
Any questions?
We're only a few minutes away from reducing this result
to Fermi's golden rule, which you have
known for a long, long time.
It's just we have made very general assumptions.
You see sort of how the assumptions propagate.
But now, if we write it down for an energy eigenbasis,
you will immediately see results you have pretty much known
since your childhood.
So we want to have energy eigenstates
of the atomic operator.
So this is sort of ground and excited state
if you think about a two-level system.
The previous equation is a differential equation
for the density matrix here.
And here is the density matrix.
So now we formulate this equation
into an energy eigenbasis.
And what do we get?
Well, we get an equation for the matrix elements.
And what matrix elements are important?
Diagonal matrix elements, which are
population of diagonal matrix element, which are coherences.
So we pretty much take this equation,
use the energy eigenbasis, and look
what do we get for the populations,
and what do we get for the coherences.

The structure is now the following--
that we have our matrix elements, a, b.

There is one part, which looks like a unitary time evolution.
This is what comes from the Hamilton operator.

You'll see that in a moment, but this is the time evolution
without relaxation.
And now we have something here which are generalized
relaxation coefficients.
And you will find, if you look further above,
that those relaxation coefficients are
directly related to the correlation
functional of the reservoir.
So we can now specify what happens between populations.
Population means that we have a differential equation,
let's say, between sigma a, a--
the polar sigma a, a--
and sigma c, c.
So we have a rate coefficient, which
connects the population in state a
with the population in state c.

And if you take this expression, you'll find several things.
You find Fermi's golden rule in a generalized way.
That's always nice.
You find Fermi's golden rule.
When you integrate over time, you often get a delta function.
And you expect to get a delta function,
because you have energy conservation.
So you get that, of course, naturally.
Secondly, we have second-order matrix element, which you
know from Fermi's golden rule.
But now we have the following situation--
that the matrix element in Fermi's golden rule
may actually depend on the state view of the environment.
So you have maybe 10 different possibilities
for the environment, and Fermi's golden rule
gives you spontaneous emission, which is
different for those 10 states.
And naturally, since we have performed the partial trace
over the environment, we have all those rates
weighted with the probability that the environment
is in one of those states.
So what you find here is a simple generalization
of Fermi's golden rule.
And if you look at the off-diagonal matrix elements--
for instance, you want to know what is this rate.
What is the rate coefficient, which gives you the time
derivative of the coherence?
And it's multiplied with the coherence.
You find now that in general, this rate coefficient
has a damping term, but it may also have an imaginary term.
And I hope you remember when we played with diagrams that we
had something similar.
That was something which we called the radiative shift.
I called it the ac Stark effect of a single photon.
And here it is a level shift, which
comes because the environment interacts with your system
and it shifts the levels a little bit.
So in addition to just relaxation,
spontaneous emission, and damping,
there's also a dispersive part--
a level shift.
And it has exactly the same structure.
Let me add that delta a, b is the difference
between the shift of state b and the shift of state a.
And those shifts have exactly the same structure.
You have to take the principle part of something
which has 1 over the difference of energies.
And we discussed that this has to be understood
by somewhere adding an infinitesimal imaginary part,
and doing the right thing with complex function.
It's actually related to the difference
between Laplace transformation and Fourier transformation.
So anyway, what I find sort of beautiful
is that we started with the most general situation.
We performed the partial trace.
We made one assumption of short correlation times.
And a lot of things we have known about quantum systems
just pops out in a very general form here.

Any questions about so far?
The coherences are, of course, more interesting
than the population.
Coherence is always something physicists
get excited about, because it captures
something which goes, often, beyond you
know a classical system--
that we have quantum mechanical coherences.
And what happens is the coefficient here,
which provides the damping of the coherence--
just comes out of the formalism-- has two parts.
And one part is an adiabatic part,
and the other one is a non-adiabatic part.
And that makes sense.
If you have quantum states, and there is a coherence--
some phase between the two--
the phase can get lost if you do a transition between the two
states, or one state undergoes a collision and is quenched.
So you definitely have one part, which is due to the fact
that the quantum states or the population changes.
And you find that there is this state-changing part, which
is pretty much the sum of all the rate coefficients leading
out of state, leading to the decay of state a
and leading to the decay of state b.
In other words, if you have a two-level system which
has a coherence, and you have decay of the excited
state and decay of the ground state,
you would expect that those decay terms appear also
in the decay of the coherence between the two levels.
And they do.
And they appear with the correct factor of 1/2.
But there is another possibility,
and this is the following--
you can have no relaxation of the population of the state.
But you can still lose the coherence.
The model you should maybe make is that you
have spin up, spin down.
You're not perturbing the populations
in spin up and spin down.
But the environment provides a fluctuating magnetic field.
Then due to the fluctuating magnetic field,
you no longer can keep track of the phase.
And that means in your density matrix,
the off-diagonal matrix elements decay.
And we find that here.
This is the second part, which in this book
is called the adiabatic part.
And the physics behind it is now pure dephasing.
So it's an independent way for coherences to decay independent
of the decay of the population.
