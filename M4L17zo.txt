So this shows here, the typical hyperfine
structure of an alkali at home.
Could be [INAUDIBLE] 87 or sodium-23.
The fact that we have only a local minimum
of the magnetic field, means we can only
trap hyperfine states, which I've marked here in green.
Where the slope is positive.
And these are the atoms where the magnetic moment
is antiparrallel with the magnetic field.
And well, for stability reasons, we usually
peak the highest state of the lower manifold,
or the highest state of the upper manifold.
In principle, it would be also possible to trap here.
You have the correct slope, but often those states
suffer from spin relaxation and collision laws.
OK.
[INAUDIBLE] slope before.
Is it actually possible to make a magnetic trap with the state
number four from the top?
So that they expel from the center.
From [INAUDIBLE]
Yeah, there is a peculiarity here.
You have to transition from the wheat field
to this storm field region.
Whenever the magnetic moment is constant,
you need a local minimum of the magnetic field.
But if the magnetic moment would change,
and you have a gradient of the magnetic field,
you could actually trap here.
So in this case, you have a magnetic field gradient,
but you have a spatial variation of the magnetic moment.
This has been discussed in one special paper
in the literature, but it has not really
found any use in realization.
Wouldn't it help-- put the majorana flops in the center,
because they're repellent from the center.
Yeah, but these atoms would undergo spin-flip collision,
so it's not a good choice.
It would help against majorana flops,
but we have many solutions against majorana flops.
And here you would solve the majorana flop problem,
