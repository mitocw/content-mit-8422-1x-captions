There is one addition we have to make to the model,
and this is the following.
We have to introduce losses, losses which
do not come from evaporation.
It can be losses due to background gas
collisions or losses due to inelastic collisions.
So let me just show you how I introduce that.
I mean, I told you that the logarithmic change
of any quantity goes with the logarithmic change in the atom
number times the coefficient.
And for reasons which become clear in a moment,
I'm now not looking at the temperature or the density
or the phase-space density.
I'm really interested in the collision rate,
because the collision rate is what
drives evaporative cooling.
As long as we have collisions, the cooling
can go on, so I want to focus now
on how does the collision rate change during evaporation.
And during evaporation, what we are changing
is the number of atoms because they are evaporating.
So by just putting everything we have said together,
I have this expression.
I assume that the number of atoms
changes as a function of time with the rate at which
high-energy atoms are produced.
And the rate-- the time constant for this
was lambda, the ratio between the evaporation time
and the elastic collision time times the elastic collision
time.
So this is just rewriting what we have discussed so far.
But now I introduce that there is another loss
rate due to inelastic collision technical problems and such,
which has a time constant of tau loss.
And if I now do introduce the famous ratio
of good to bad collisions, good collisions
are elastic collisions, which drive evaporation.
Bad collisions are collisions where atoms are just
lost due to technical reasons and inelastic collisions.
So if I define this ratio of good to bad collisions,
I have now this equation here for the--
which tells me how the collision rate changes with time.
Just wondering is a dt missing here or not?
Yes.
So there should be a dt.
So this tells me how the relative, or how the collision
rate changes in the function with the function of time.
But now remember, since this is not
the derivative of the collision rate,
it's a derivative of the collision
rate over the collision rate, it's a logarithmic derivative.
What we are talking here about, if you please add dt to it,
we are talking about is the collision rate exponentially
growing when this coefficient is positive or is it
exponentially decaying when this coefficient is negative?
So you realize that we obtain a threshold condition
when this coefficient is larger or smaller than zero,
and this is called the threshold for runaway evaporation.
So let me just summarize.
The physics of power loss, the physics of exponential increase
and decrease, actually means that the experimental situation
is often talking about a threshold.
If you are above threshold and you get evaporative cooling
going, you have a positive exponent,
and it will go faster and faster and faster.
If this exponent is negative, you
have slowed down evaporation, you can evaporate a little bit,
but it will pretty much come to a standstill.
So this is why quite often, the experimental realization
of evaporative cooling requires to put enough atoms
from the laser cooling stage at sufficiently low temperature
into a magnetic trap that you fulfill the threshold condition
for runaway evaporation.

Any questions about that?
So in other words, what we have found out,
we have found here an expression for the threshold
of runaway evaporation, and it tells us
that we need a minimum ratio of good to bad collisions.
We may need 100 elastic collision
until we have one inelastic collision,
and then our ratio is 100.
And you will see in a minute, if this ratio is 100,
if then we can make the right-hand side in such a way
that we have runaway evaporation.
OK.
So the left-hand side is the ratio
of good to bad collisions.
This maybe determined how good our vacuum is.
What determines the right-hand side?
Well, we talked about it.
Delta is our trap, our trapping potential, linear or quadratic.
Alpha and lambda depend on the threshold Ada,
how aggressive are we in setting a threshold in energy
for the evaporating atoms.
And what I'm showing you here is the condition.
If I vary the ratio Ada, I call this expression Rmin,
and my ratio of good to bad collisions
has to be better than that.
If you just look at the solid curve for a parabolic trap,
this shows you that you have to pick your parameter Ada
sort of between five and seven.
If you pick Ada too fast, evaporation is too slow
and you need a much better ratio of good to bad collisions.
In other words, you need a better vacuum, for instance.
But if you put Ada too low, you are not
cooling enough because you're cutting
too deep into the distribution.
You will also realize that if you take a linear power-law,
like a quadrupole trap, you get the dashed line,
and the dashed line has a much lower ratio of-- has
a much lower value of Rmin.
In other words, if your vacuum is not good enough
and you have losses, in a linear trap,
you can still overcome it by picking your Ada
in this regime, whereas for a parabolic trap,
you need at least a two or three times
better vacuum to get into the runaway regime.

Anyway, this is how you can look at those equations
and figure out what is needed to get into evaporative cooling.
Colin.
Do you need to be in a runaway regime to get PEC?
Not necessarily.
Some early experiments have done--
I think the experiment, the first experiment
of Eric Cornell, I think they never saw this speed up.
They had sort of constant evaporation.
Maybe the evaporation, the cooling rate
was even slightly going down.
So you don't necessarily need the exponential speedup,
but you have to be in a regime where, at least, if you're not
gaining speed, you're not losing too much speed.
But yeah, I mean, you can just take the equations
and analyze them and figure out if you
are in a favorable regime.
And ultimately, it's fairly easy to integrate those equations
as a function of time and have completely realistic models.
But what I presented to you here is a sort
of a simple analytic model.
And I used the criterion for runaway evaporation
to discuss how you have to pick your truncation parameter
and what happens if you have a different trapping potential.
So based on those models, you will find out
that if you truncate at an Ada parameter of six, you'll lose--
every truncation of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
means about 1% loss in the atom number.
And after 600 collisions, after 600 elastic collision times,
you have lowered the atom number by 100,
but your phase-space density has increased
by six orders of magnitude.
And that means if you have two orders of magnitude
in the number and get six orders of magnitude
in the phase-space density, then your gamma factor, which
I haven't really defined it here,
but it's of the effector which tells you
how the phase-space density increase.
Every order of magnitude in the number
boosts the phase-space density by three orders of magnitude.
And that's regarded as very favorable.
So in other words, we have talked
a lot about laser cooling.
In laser cooling, in the standard laser cooling schemes,
you are typically six orders of magnitude away
form quantum degeneracy.
And this sort of tells you how evaporative cooling
can get you there.
You should expect to lose approximately a number of 100
in the number of atoms.
And that's what it takes you to go from laser
cooling to quantum degeneracy.

And you can estimate what your time
is by asking what is an elastic collision rate
right after laser cooling.
If your elastic collision rate is two seconds,
and you take 600 collisions to get to PEC,
you know that it will take you 20 minutes
and you'd better work on a vacuum with just 20 minutes'
lifetime.
Or, alternatively, you improve your laser cooling
or you do some idiopathic compression
in your magnetic trap to make sure
that your elastic collision time is faster,
that you can afford 600 collisions within the lifetime
given by other parameters.
