We want to now describe single quantum systems.

But when I do that--
it will become clear at the end of this unit
but I want to give you the warning right away.
The way how I describe now a single quantum system
may not be unique.
There is actually an infinite number of ways--
I've already mentioned that to you--
that there is an infinite number of ways
to unravel a density matrix.
I mentioned that you can write every density matrix
as a probability of pure states, weighted probability of being
in pure states.
But that all with different choices.
You can get an infinite number of different combinations
of pure states and construct your density matrix.
So this was sort of at the level of the density matrix.
But similarly-- and this will come out of this discussion
today--
there is also an infinite number of ways
to unravel the dynamics, the dynamics
involved in the evolution of an open quantum system.
So with that, I want to describe the quantum Monte-Carlo wave
function method.
So in the quantum Monte-Carlo wave function method we
perform--
we don't need an experiment, we don't
need sophisticated experiments to observe a single quantum
system.
It's a theoretical method.
But we perform thought or gedankenexperiments.
So our gedankenexperiments is that we perform measurements.
So we assume we have--
when we want to describe an ensemble of atoms
we assume we have a single atom, we assume it emits photon,
and then we assume that the photon is detected.

So the moment the photon is detected
we know, for instance, that the atom is in the ground state.
And so our quantum Monte-Carlo simulation follows now
the trajectory of the single quantum system by saying,
I toss a coin.
There is a certain probability for detecting the photon.
If I take the photon, the system I know is in the ground state.
If I don't detect the photon it's not
in the ground state, and such.
And this probabilistic approach is just simulated
in the quantum Monte-Carlo sense.
So what is in essence--
what is the essence of the quantum
Monte-Carlo method is that we allow a small timestep delta t.
It's a real time simulation.
And there is a small probability that the system
has decayed at that time.
So we may now toss a coin, use of a random function generator
and ask has spontaneous emission taken place?
And then the two possibilities are yes,
and we continue whatever the outcome, whatever the quantum
state is, or we say no.
And then, with the those over the probability p we say yes.
With a probability one minus p, we say no.
And then we continue the simulation accordingly.
So this will become much, much clearer
when I write down the formalism for you.
But there is one important aspect which is really
want to discuss with you.
And this is the essence of the method.
Namely, how does a wave function change by a measurement?
So this is the essential, the only conceptual part
for the quantum Monte-Carlo wave function.
Afterwards I just show you.
Once you have this, once we have cleared up
this conceptional part, the rest is just a few re-creations
and we immediately show that the quantum Monte-Carlo wave
function method is equivalent with the optical Bloch
equation.
But let's really feature and take
some time for discussing the concept,
namely the change of a wave function
by a quantum measurement.
And maybe this carries home to you
is that the nature of an open system,
we have a quantum system which interacts with the environment,
is actually that the environment permanently
performs measurements.
And you will actually see that the idea of performing
measurements formalized in the quantum Monte-Carlo sense,
gives us an equation for the density matrix
which is identical to the optical Bloch equation.
So in other words, you can say I'm
re-deriving for you master equation now,
but from a very, very different perspective,
from the perspective of an environment which constantly
performs measurement.
So let's go through that, what happens in a measurement.
Well, if our initial state is the ground state,
I'm starting very in trivial ways,
well, there is no measurement because the particle will stay
in the ground state forever.

Let's go to the next situation, that our atom starts out
in an excited state.
Now in the timestep delta t we have two possibilities.
A photon can be observed or no photon is observed.
When the photon is observed we know for sure
that the system is now projected into the ground state.
If no photon is observed, well, the system
is still in the excited state.
So we discussed what happens when the system is initially
in the ground state and when the system is initially
in the excited state.
But now comes the following question.
We prepare the system in a superposition
of ground and excited state.
And we want to discuss what happens
when the photon is observed, what happens
when no photon is observed.
I think, if you observe the photon, it's pretty clear.
We have to assume after photon emission,
