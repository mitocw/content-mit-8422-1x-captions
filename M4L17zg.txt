So, energy conservation.
Energy conservation has to be discussed with two
different perspectives.
One is a transient phenomenon, which I'll do in a few minutes,
but let me first discuss something which is sort of
[INAUDIBLE].
And this is the following-- you have atoms, which
move over a standing wave.
And I used the test atom picture to show you
that for strong [INAUDIBLE] and standing wave,
we have a friction force.
So the atom, this was the Sisyphus cooling
that the atom is climbing up hills, does some transition,
climbs up the next hill.
But whenever the atom climbs up more hills,
then it scoots down.
And therefore there is work done, there is a net force.
And this net force provides friction,
it slows down the velocity of the atom.
My question to you is where has this energy gone?
The kinetic energy lost by the atom,
where does this energy appear?

Which fields?
Modulation of a laser beam.
Well, we have two fields-- the laser fields--
Oh.
--And we have maybe spontaneous emission.
But the force is only a stimulated force, so yeah.

Which fields?
The laser field. 'Cause when you stimulate into the laser
field, [INAUDIBLE]
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
--phase modulator [INAUDIBLE].
Well, I have a little bit problem with that,
because when the atoms, the force
comes from distributing photons from one standing
wave to the other one, and these are photons of equal frequency.
So in that sense the net effect is that those two laser beams
are--
actually the atom moves here, so what should happen to the laser
beams?
Photons are not disappearing.

I will later tell you, in the transition picture--
and this maybe you have already done your homework assignment
number 10--
there is something happening to the laser beam,
but this would only happen when atoms fly in
and fly out of a laser beam, then
we have a different situation.
But here, if the atoms stay in the laser beam, the laser beam,
so to speak, sees a constant index of refraction medium,
it just goes through and nothing has
happened to the photons except that occasionally photons
are spontaneously emitted.

Well, OK if it's not the laser beams, what remains now?

Spontaneous emission.
Now, how can spontaneous emission carry the energy? .
What is the spectrum of spontaneous emission?

Triplet?
Yes, the Mollow triplet.
We have the central carrier.
Thus the carrier is not carrying away any energy
because it is at the laser frequency.
Now we have two sidebands.
Can the sidebands carry away energy?
[INAUDIBLE]
Pardon?
[INAUDIBLE]
A symmetry is what sense?
[INAUDIBLE] are the same.
Well, but didn't we discuss with a radiative cascade
that the blue-detuned sideband comes
when you go from the upper crest level to the lower crest level?
And in the lower crest level you can only
emit a red-detuned sideband, not a blue-detuned sideband.
Or we said in the radiative cascade
after one blue-detuned photon, there is a red-detuned photon.
So the number of photons emitted on the red sideband
and on the blue sideband are exactly equal.

[INAUDIBLE]
[INAUDIBLE] have to [INAUDIBLE] picture
where the red-detuned sideband was emitted
in a lower field, [INAUDIBLE].
Yes.
So the situation is the following--
the atom emits an equal number red, blue, red-detuned,
blue-detuned, red-detuned, blue-detuned.
But when it emits the blue-detuned,
the sideband spacing is larger because it
emits the blue-detuned photon when it's on top of the hill.
And the red-detuned photon is emitted
when the atom is more in the dark
and therefore the sideband spacing is lower.
So it alternates-- blue, red, blue, red--
but the blue-detuned photon is emitted
when the generalized Rabi frequency is larger, when
the atoms is at an antinode.
And the red-detuned is more preferably emitted
when the photon is at a node of the standing wave.
So it is the difference of this modulation--
the sidebands are modulated--
and there is a preference to emit the [? blue detuned ?]
sideband when the sideband spacing is larger
than the red-detuned case.
And this is where the energy goes.
You could make the argument, then,
that would give a simple picture for the maximum cooling rate.
Yes.
Where you have omega times your [INAUDIBLE].
Yes, that's exactly how last class I calculated the cooling
rate.
The cooling rate, the energy removed from the system, is
an--

Yeah, I said it is the height of the lattice,
but the height of the lattice is also the amount by which the--
the lattice is nothing else than the generalized Rabi frequency.
This is the energy level of one crest level,
and therefore the lattice is the increment
by which we modulate blue and red sidebands, exactly.
This can be quantitatively worked out.
If I had another half hour I can do it for you.
It's in the references, but this is the physical picture
for cooling.

But so you realize that these are one of the subtleties--
we can understand the force simply
from simple picture energy levels, Sisyphus cooling
and such.
But in order to understand where the energy comes from we
need the Mollow triplet.
We need spontaneous emission.
So the force comes from the redistribution of photons.
It's a stimulated redistribution of photons,
which is responsible for the force,
but the energy balance comes from what
can be neglected for the momentum balance,
namely the few spontaneous emission
events and especially those which involve
the blue and red sidebands.
And it beautifully works together
and all the equations of physics are obeyed.
OK, but that tells you now that the cooling effect
hinges on spontaneous emission.
And, yes, spontaneous emission is dissipation,
and whenever you want a friction coefficient,
you want dissipation.
You need an open system, the open system
is spontaneous emission into those nodes.
So let's now talk about an opposite situation
where we do not have any spontaneous emission.
And I think almost all the people
who work with optical lattices use infrared lasers for them
or [INAUDIBLE] detuned laser where spontaneous emission
happens only once every 20, 30 seconds to a 100
seconds per atom, so we can really neglect it.
So now the question is the following--
assume you have a focused laser beam
and you load a [INAUDIBLE] Einstein [INAUDIBLE]
at the edge of the cloud, and now the condensate is
accelerated, sucked in into the laser beam.
So now the atom has kinetic energy.
The question is where does this kinetic energy come from?
And this time we do not have spontaneous emission,
as we have when we do frictional cooling.
So the question is now where does the energy
of the atom come from?

I thought we were talking about a dielectric medium that's
coming from those light rays that are reflected or not
reflected.
[INAUDIBLE]
It comes from those light rays.
But the atom is a dielectric medium-- that's good.
But the reflection, the deflection of light rays--

at least in leading order, you would
say photons of the same energy are deflected.
But in the [INAUDIBLE], it says the atom [INAUDIBLE]
absorbs [INAUDIBLE], and then it gets [INAUDIBLE].
I would hate to use a picture of absorption and emission.
What really happens is it's just scattering.
It's scattering.
You scatter a photon, which has one frequency in two
different direction.
It's really light scattering.

Well, you have a homework assignment on that,
and I don't need to go into details because it can easily
be worked out.
But what happens is the following--
the atom is a dielectric medium.
It has an index of refraction.
And if you suddenly put an index of refraction
into a laser beam, then you change
the phase of the laser beam.
The atoms act as an electro-optical modulator,
and they change the frequency of the transmitted photons.
You have a homework assignment on that.
So if you increase the number of atoms in your laser beam
because they move in, this is then
the phase of the transmitted photons is shifted.
If the phase of the photons is shifted during a certain time,
phase over time is frequency.
So therefore you will see when the atoms move in
and gain kinetic energy, the transmitted photons
of the laser beam have lost some energy,
they are slightly shifted to the right.
So in other words, it's funny, but if you have a dipole trap,
and the laser beam is focused, and atoms
slosh through the trap, if you would carefully
analyze the frequency of the transmitted beam,
you will find that it's a little bit blue, little bit, little
bit red, little bit blue, little bit red,
and this compensates for the kinetic energy.
Again, I don't think you'll find that in any textbook.
It confused me for a while until I could work it out.
But the homework assignment gives you
an exact [INAUDIBLE] model where you can be exactly sure what
I told you.

So these are the two situations here--
it's either spontaneous emission-- which
is responsible for cooling.
But here we have a conservative potential,
and in this conservative potential
the only player is the laser beam which is transmitted.
And indeed it is the photons which have been transmitted.
And usually you wouldn't put that into your picture.
Remember, the dipole force can be
explained by eliminating the coherent field of the laser
field for canonical transformation.
And then we have a C number, we have
a classical electric field--
this is your Hamiltonian.
And from this Hamiltonian, you derive that you
have a conservative potential.
But if you now ask where the energy goes,
the energy, really, in this situation
goes into a frequency shift of the photons.
Also, in your Hamiltonian, you have
assumed that the electric field is an external classical field
e0 times cosine omega t.

Well, if you want my advice, whenever
you use the AC stark shift for trapping,
just use the AC stark shift and regarded it
as a classical potential, and just completely
forget that there are photons behind.
Because if you want to account what really happens
to the photons, what really happens
to the energy in the system, it really gets subtle
and it can get really confusing.
