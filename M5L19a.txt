Quantum gases has become interesting
because of interactions.
And in my lecture today and in my last lecture,
I want to introduce you to Boser gases and Fermer
gases with interactions and they both turn superfluid.
And the superfluid properties are
determined by the interactions between the atoms.
So the purpose of those lectures is number one,
to acquaint you with important phenomenon cold gases,
superfluity, superfluity in lattices, superfluity
just in free gas, and in a normal gas without lattice,
and superfluity of fermions.
But at the same time, I also want to have sort of a theme
for you, how we deal with interactions.
And that deal and that kind of theme
is that how theoretically we reduce unsolvable Hamiltonians
to Hamiltonians which can be solved.
And you will see that actually appearing
in different situations with similarities,
but important differences.
So just to remind you we started out with the interacting Boser
gas in a homogeneous system.
We have a very general way to describe scattering.
Two particles with initial momentum
disappear and two particles with momentum appear.
This is a scattering event.
Now, this means we have products of four operators, which
is very difficult to solve.
And the Bogoliubov approximation,
which we discussed on Monday, replaces the operator
for the condensate for the zero momentum state with C number.
Saying that while n naught, n naught plus one
is the same, little bit waving your hands, but it's also,
you can say, the microscopic limit.
When we photon field with many, many photons,
we can use a C number in our Hamiltonian
to describe the electric field.
So that's the same spirit.
So maybe I should emphasize it.
This is for atoms, what you're used
to do with photons for your whole life.
OK, with that, we have transformed the Hamiltonian
into a bi-linear expression.
And so the moment you have a bi-linear expression,
you do a Bogoliubov transformation.
You simply diagonalize it by finding a new set of operators
where the cross term between a and b or between a
of k and a of minus k disappear.
And then you have solved it.
And this is what we arrived at the end of the last lecture.
We have, with those approximations,
we have diagonalized the Hamiltonian.
Our Hamiltonian is now, you can say a harmonic oscillator
Hamiltonian or you can say it has
become a gas of non-interacting quasi-particles.
Each of those operators creates a quasi-particle
and the quasi-particle energies e of k.
And I explained to you that as expected
the quasi-particle energy is simply particles with momentum
h by k for a high momentum.
Because in high excitation a Bose condensate
is a free particle, but a low lying excitation
is affected in a major way by all these interactions
with a Bose-Einsetin condensate.
And that turns the quadratic dispersion of relation
into a linear one.
Or you can say, that turns a free particle
into a phonon or sound wave.

So that's my review of last class.
Are there any questions before we go further?
Cory.
So does this require low density and weak interactions?
Or one or the other?
We will come a little bit later to that.
But in the end, there is a small parameter.
The small parameter will be N-A cubed, the gas parameter, N,
the density, A cubed, the scattering links.
It's often-- it's usually the dimensionless combination
of the two, which decides whether we are in the weakly
or strongly interacting limit.
There is another assumption which we have made here,
but it's related to that, as you will see in a few moments,
that most of the atoms in the condensate.
We assumed N naught is weak.
The condensate depletion, the number
of atoms who are not in the condensate,
