Let's move on now and talk about higher intensity.
The high intensity case we discussed in great detail
in 8421.
But you pretty much, I think, know also
from basic quantum physics what happens if you take a two level
system and drive it strongly.
If you drive it strongly, stronger
than spontaneous emission, that means
there is a limit where you can just
forget about spontaneous emission in leading order.
And the system is nothing else than a two level
system coupled by a strong monochromatic drive.
So I assume you have all heard about the solution.
You get Rabi oscillation between ground and excited state.
So the high intensity limit are Rabi oscillations
at the Rabi frequency.
So what happens now to the spectrum of the emitted light
if you are in the limit that you have Rabi oscillation
of the atomic system?

And I want you to think classically or semiclassically.
Three peaks?
Three peaks you generate sidebands.
Classically you have an emitter, an oscillating charge,
but now you want to throw in that the atom goes
from the ground to the excited state,
from the excited to the ground state.
So to speak, when it's in the ground state it cannot emit.
When it's in the excited state it can emit and such.
So you should think about an oscillating dipole which
is now intensity modulated.
And you know when you take a classic light source, which
is monochromatic, but put on top of it
an intensity modulation at frequency omega Rabi
the solution of that are three peaks.
The carrier, which is the laser frequency,
plus two sidebands at omega Rabi.
So therefore, what we now expect for the spectrum is
we have the laser frequency.
And this is our result for low intensity.
However when we, in the limit of strong drive--
and you will see in a moment where strong drive really comes
in--
so if you have this modulation at the Rabi frequency
you obtain sidebands at the Rabi frequency.
And the fact that there is a structure with three peaks
is actually the famous Mollow triplet.
I know when I was a student there was big excitement
because people measured, for the first time, the Mollow triplet.
You need high resolution, lasers and such,
and people were just ready to measure that.
Now it seems something which is just mentioned in basic courses
because it's such a basic phenomenon.
OK.
But let's work a little bit more on that.
Namely, the Rabi frequency is the Rabi frequency
of the drive where you can see the coupling matrix element.
But when we have a detuning-- and this is what you want
to discuss, now--
you have to add the detuning in quadrature.
So this is the frequency at which the atomic population
oscillates.
And it is, just saying semiclassically,
the modulation of the atomic population
which creates a sidebands.
Now if you take that to the limit of large detuning
or small drive, small Rabi frequency, this becomes delta.
So that actually means, if we go to our stick diagram here,
the laser frequency is, of course, detuned by delta
from the atomic frequency.
But the Rabi frequency is delta and this is the Rabi frequency.
So now maybe some people who pressed
A and B feel vindicated, because now you
have a component of the emission spectrum
which is at the atomic resonance frequency.
And you have a second peak which is omega 0 minus 2 delta or 2
omega Rabi.
