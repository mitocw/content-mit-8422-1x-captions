So we've done two things.
We've done the very, very simple derivation
using the beam splitter model, where you may not even
notice where I did the mark of approximation,
because I jumped from beam splitter to beam splitter
and left all the correlations behind.
Here in the most general calculation,
you have seen exactly where it enters.
But maybe now you have the full forest in front of you.
And you don't recognize the trees anymore.
So let me wrap up this lecture by now focusing
on the system we want to discuss further on,
namely a two level system interacting with a vacuum
through spontaneous emission.
But I also want to make some generalizations.
I want to give you some generalizations
about what kind of environments are
possible in quantum physics.
So this part I actually owe to Professor Ike Chuang,
who wonderfully compiled that.
So what I want to do now is I want
to draw your attention to the operator
form, which is rather unique.
Remember when we did second order perturbation theory,
we had the commutator of v with the commutator of v and o.
This came from iterating the exact equation of motion
for the density matrix.
And we want to specialize that now
to the Jaynes-Cummings model.
In the end, at least in this course,
we always come back to the Jaynes-Cummings model,
because it captures a lot of what we want to explore.
So the Jaynes-Cummings model in the rotating wave approximation
is very simple.
It raises the atom from ground to excited state
and destroys a photon.
Or it does the opposite.
So this is our simple interaction between our system,
the two level atom, and our reservoir, which is just
the vacuum of all the modes.
And you, again, recognize what I said in general.
You usually always find a bi-linear form, an operator
which acts on the modes on the reservoir, on the vacuum,
and an operator which acts on the atom.

Now we want to make the explicit assumption
that the initial state of the reservoir is the vacuum state.
It's empty.
And I want to show you what is the structure
of the operators we obtain.
And so if you put v into here, you
have first the commutator with o, which I write down here.
And then we have to take another commutator with v.
And the result of that is the following,
that when it comes to relaxation process,
based on the general structure of the time
evolution of quantum mechanics, we
have these double commutator.
And the operator, which couples our system to the environment,
is a raising and lowering operator.
The atom, because it interacts with the environment,
either absorbs a photon or emits a photon.
But those operators, sigma plus and sigma minus,
appear now always as products, because we
have two occurrences of interaction v.
But if you look at the double commutator
structure, the operators sigma plus, sigma minus appears--
this is just the general structure
of this double commutator--
appears to the left side of the atomic density matrix,
to the right side of the atomic density matrix.
And then there is the cross term,
where the atomic density matrix is in the middle of the two.
So this is actually something which
is very general and very important
in the theory of open quantum system.
What I'm discussing with you now is this famous Lindblad form.
And the story goes like that.
You want to know, what are possible environments ,
not just the empty vacuum?
You can have fluctuating fields.
You can have, you name it.
But if you are saying that your environment interacts
with your system through an operator, and our operator
is now the operator sigma minus, which
is the spontaneous emission.
Unitarity, the structure, the mathematical structural
a varied quantum theory means that if your system interacts
with the environment by emitting a photon sigma minus,
this is now the structure of the master equation.
This is the structure of the time evolution of the density
matrix.
So the operator sigma minus and its conjugate
and its emission conjugate sigma plus
always have to appear in this combination.
Yes, Colin?
This is still in the interaction picture?
There's no dynamical phase evolution?

What we do in general, if the system is driven by a laser
beam, for instance Rabi oscillation,
we simply add up the dynamics of the Rabi oscillation
of the unitary time evolution to the time evolution
done by the reservoir.
So this form is always in the interaction picture?
This is, you would say, this form
is what is the relaxation provided by the environment.
And if you drive the system in addition
with a coherent field unitary time evolution,
you would add it to it.

So in other words, what I'm telling
you here is that this is the general structure.
And if you have a system which interacts
with the environment in five different ways,
with a dipole movement, with a magnetic moment and such,
you have maybe five interaction terms.
And then you have to perform the sum over five operators.
And here one of them is the sigma minus operator.
So in other words, if you want to know
what is the whole world of possibilities for quantum
system to relax dissipate with an environment,
you can pretty much take any operator
which acts on your system.
But then put it into these so-called Lindblad form,
and you have a possible environment.

And I mentioned, I think last week,
that people are now in our field actively working
on environmental engineering.
They want to expose a quantum system
to an artificial environment and hope
the system is not relaxing, let's say,
to a boring ground state, but to a fancy correlated state.

So what this Lindblad form, if the operator appears
in this way, what it ensures is the following.
Just imagine if we have an equation,
an derivative of the density matrix,
which depends on the density matrix,
you could divide down a differential equation and say,
is it possible.
Well, it has to be consistent with quantum physics.
You have certain requirements.
One requirement is that rho, the density matrix,
always has to be a density matrix.
The trace equal 1 has to be conserved.
A density matrix always must have non-negative eigenvalues.
Otherwise what you write down, it
may be a nice differential equation.
But quantum mechanically, it's nonsense.
But now there is one more thing, which is also necessary.
This time evolution of the system's density matrix
must come from a unitary time evolution of a bigger system.
So you must be able to extend your system into a bigger
system, which is now the environment.
And this whole system must follow a Schrodinger equation
with a Hamiltonian as a unitary time evolution.
And this is very restrictive.
You cannot just write down a differential equation and hope
that this fulfills the requirement.
And what people have shown is under very general assumptions,
it is the Lindblad form, which allows for it.
So some operator always has to appear in this form.

So often in these this Lindblad form,
you have an operator, which is called a jump operator, which
is responsible for the measurement which
the environment does on your system.
The jump operator is here, the operator
which takes the atom from the excited to the ground state.
With that you emit a photon.
And the photon can be measured.
So often you can describe a system by a jump operator.
And if the jump operator is put into this Lindblad form,
then you have a valid master equation for your system.
So let me wrap up.
If you take now the definition of the raising and lowering
operator, and you take the form I've shown you, the Lindblad
form, you find now this differential equation
for your two level system.

And this is one part of the optical Bloch equation.
Now coming to Colin's question, if you
include the time evolution of the classical field--
this is the coherent evolution of the Bloch vector
which I showed at the beginning of the class--
and we add this and what I wrote down
at the beginning of the class, then we
find the famous Optical Bloch equations
in the Jaynes-Cummings model.
So these are now the Optical Bloch equations.
And I hope you enjoy, now after this complicated discussion,
how simple they are.
And it is this simple set of equations,
which we will use in the rest of the course
to describe the time evolution of the system.
Just because I did some generalizations
about the Lindblad equation, I copied that into the lecture
notes from Wikipedia.
And probably now you understand what
is the most general Lindblad equation.
It has a Hamiltonian part.
And then it has jump operators like your sigma minus operator.
But it has to come in the form that the jump
operator and its complex conjugate, Hermitian conjugate,
is on the left side, on the right side, and left
and the right of the density matrix.
So this is a generalization I've mentioned.
with that, I think we have derived the master equation.
And on Wednesday, we will look at rather simple solutions,
transient and steady-state solution of the Optical Bloch
equation.
