So this takes care, actually, of most
of the electromagnetic field.
We'll come back to that in a moment.
The next thing is we want to use the full quantum solution
for the atomic dipole operator.
And that means we want to remind ourselves
of the solution of the optical Bloch equations.
Talking about the optical Bloch equations,
I just have to remind you of what we did in class.
But I have to apologize.
It's a little bit exercise in notation.
Because in atom-photon interaction
they use a slightly different notation
than you finding other sources.
On the other hand, I think I've nicely prepared it for you.
And I give you the translation table.
In atom-photon interaction, they regard the Bloch vector.
And we have introduced the components, u, v, and w,
as a fictitious spin 1/2.
Therefore, you find, with this kind of old-fashioned letters,
sx, sy, sz, in atom-photon interaction.
The other thing, if you open the book, atom-photon interaction,
is that there are operators--
a density matrix, the atomic density matrix, sigma,
and sigma head.
One is in the rotating frame, and one is in the lab frame.
So we have to go back and forth to do that,
but the result is fairly trivial.
So this is simply the definition.
First of all, the density matrix is a full description
of the atomic system.
But instead of dealing with matrix elements of the density
matrix, it's more convenient for a two-level system
to use the fictitious spin or the Bloch vector.
So the important equation--
these are the optical Bloch equations--
is the equation A20 in API.
And it's simply the first order differential equation
for the components of the optical Bloch vector, u, v,
and w.
Notation is, as usual, the laser detuning delta l.
Omega 1 is the Rabi frequency.
And this is the parametrization of
the classical electromagnetic field which drives the system.
Now, this equation is identical to the equation
we discussed in the unit on solutions of optical Bloch
equations.
We just call the Rabi frequency g.
Delta l was called delta.
And then-- factors of 2 are always was confusing--
the components r, x, y, z are 2 times uvw.
And the reason for that is some people
prefer that it represents spin 1/2,
so they want to normalize things to 1/2.
Or if you want to have unit vectors,
you throw in a factor of 2.
But that is all.
So if you're confused about a factor of 2,
it's exactly the substitution which has been made.
So these are the optical Bloch equations.
And what we need now is the solution.
