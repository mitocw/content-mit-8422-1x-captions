If you have the 50/50 superposition of ground
and excited state, and let's say the time
for spontaneous emission is 10 nanoseconds.

But now, you wait one second.
And after one second, no photon has been observed.

What is your prediction?
In what state is the system at this point?
Is the system in the ground state?
Or is the system still in a superposition
of ground and excited state?
Well, since we have the clicker, you can tell me.
Is it still a superposition state?
Or is the system in the ground state?
