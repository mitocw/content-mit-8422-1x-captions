Let me now formalize exactly how this
is done, with all the bells and whistles.
We assume we have an initial wave function, which
is now an arbitrary superposition state
of ground and excited state.
And we have the environment, which in this case
we assume is a zero photon state.
It's a vacuum.
And we want to exactly solve the Schrodinger
equation for that system.
But we restrict ourselves too much to a very small timestep.
The small timestep is smaller than anything else,
than the natural decay time, maybe the inverse Rabi
frequency, if you drive the system.
You're not doing it here but I will later
show you how you can add a laser beam and drive the system.
Or it should also be smaller than the inverse detuning.
So what is very important here is
that we want to deal only with simple cases.
Namely, one photon has been emitted or no photon.
So we want to make sure that there
is at most one spontaneous emission event using the time
delta t.
So what I'm writing down now is the total wave function
of the system plus the environment.
And now we can evolve it.
We can ask what happens, what is the wave function time later.
This can be exactly done by time-dependent perturbation
theory.
And the result is that the system
will be in a superposition of ground and excited state.
And we want to calculate the coefficients
alpha prime and beta prime.
And we still have the vacuum state.
But then we have the possibility that a photon has been emitted.
In that case, we are in the ground state.
And the direct product with the environment
involves now a photon emitted into a certain direction
with wave factor k, with a polarization epsilon.
And we have coefficients beta k epsilon.
And we have to sum over all possibilities for the photon
to be emitted.
So we call this--
so the wave function of the total system has now two parts.
It's a wave function, which I called psi zero.
This is the wave function which involves
no photon in the environment.
And the wave function psi1 involves
one photon in the environment.
So this is the [INAUDIBLE] which seems very natural.
But it's also, you could immediately
prove that these are the only possibilities how
the system can evolve.
And we can verify this by using time-dependent perturbation
theory.

Almost everybody of you has seen it in
either in 8421 or in a more basic course
in quantum physics.
It's time-dependent perturbation theory
for emission of a photon.
But usually when you see those treatments, the reservoir,
the environment is not treated as explicitly as we do it here.
The theory where this is treated exactly in this way
how we need it is the Wigner-Weisskopf theory, which
is nothing else than the perturbative approach
but it's really a perturbation theory not just
for the atomic system, how we sometimes present it
in a simplified version, it's perturbation theory
for the total wave function of the complete system.
[INAUDIBLE]
So you mentioned the time interval of the chosen dt
is much smaller than a lot of things.
But here we're ignoring a [INAUDIBLE] counter rotating
terms, in which case, we're still
a large enough timestep that's [INAUDIBLE], so to speak?

I simply say this because I expected
to be an e with a photon term from the g going up,
so to speak.

Yes.

The counter rotating term.

The first answer I wanted to give,
this is exact perturbation theory.
But I think I get myself into trouble if I would allow--
I would get myself in trouble if I would allow the timestep
to be extremely short, shorter than 1
over omega because during the time 1 over omega
we have counter rotating terms.
Or in other words, particularly in the ground
state during a time 1 over omega,
particularly in the ground state, can emit a photon
and re-absorb it.
This way, those weird diagrams with virtual states,
which we discussed earlier in this course.
So I think I want to assume here it's--
I haven't done-- that the timestep is larger than omega
to the minus 1.
As you know, the counter rotating term
has a detuning delta, which is two omega.
So therefore it is excluded.
In other words, when we talk about photons
sent into the environment we want
to talk about real photons and not virtual photons.
Yes, good point.

OK.
So if you do simple lowest order time-dependent perturbation
theory, in Wigner-Weisskopf approach,
you get an exact result for beta prime.
You find that beta prime in this superposition.
You see original amplitude beta but it has decayed with e
to the minus gamma over 2dt.
And since we are only interested in small timesteps
we can do linear expansion of that.
The probability, dp, that a photon has been emitted
is the norm of this wave function psi1.
And this, using Wigner-Weisskopf perturbation theory,
is gamma dt times the amplitude squared, that the system was
excited to begin with.
And because of the conservation of the norm the wave function,
the norm of the wave function psi 0, which
is the wave function without a photon being emitted,
is 1 minus dp.

So what I'm telling you here is that this
is an exact result of time-dependent perturbation
theory.
Often when textbooks treat spontaneous emission,
they are more interested in getting Fermi's golden rule
and this rate.
But the same approach, if you just write it down,
tells you how the amplitude in the excited state evolves.

So therefore, what we learn from perturbation theory that alpha
prime and beta prime, the coefficients of the wave
function without emission of a photon.
This evolution of the wave function
occurs with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.

And this non-Hermitian Hamiltonian
is our Hamiltonian for the atomic system.
But then we have to account for spontaneous decay.
And this is done by this non-Hermitian part.
So occasionally you may have heard
that people wave their hands and say
your system is described by a Hamiltonian, which has
an imaginary part for decay.
And this is sort of phenomenological.
This is definitely not the case because even
if you have an Hamiltonian like this,
a pure state would simply decay and remain a pure state.
What we are doing here explicitly
is we deal with probability in a correct way.
Every time the system can branch out
into two different possibilities, two
different dimensions of the density matrix,
one has probability delta p, one has probability
1 minus delta p.
And it is only the wave function associated with probability 1
minus delta p which evolves with this Hamiltonian.
So what I'm telling you is the exact solution
for the evolution of the total system in terms of a density
matrix for the atomic system.

And this is exact.

So that means the procedure how we implement
this exact solution of perturbation theory
is the following.
We have a timestep delta p.
We compute what is the probability
that a photon will be emitted.
Then we need a random number generator.
So we need a number epsilon, which is a random number chosen
in the interval 0 and 1.
If this random number turns out to be smaller than delta p then
we continue our time evolution on the computer
that psi is now in the ground state.
And maybe there is a laser beam which excites it again,
and such.
I will add a few bells and whistles later.
Otherwise, psi, our wave function,
is now the wave function, which is the time evolution
with a non-Hermitian operator of the original wave function psi.
And since we have a real wave function now
with probability 1, we have to renormalize the wave function
by this denominator.
And then we execute the next timestep.
This means go to two and do the next timestep.
And then you have, so to speak, if you do it many, many times,
you get a time direct trajectory of so to speak one experiment.
And then you start again with your system in a wave function
psi and you accumulate a second experiment.
And maybe you do it 10,000 times to get enough statistics.
And then you sum up everything you want
and calculate all the expectation
values you want to know about your quantum system.
