So this is a steady state solution,
but now we can go back to the rate equation
and say the time derivative of the rate equation
has to relax to the steady state.
This is nothing else than rewriting the equation above.
But by rewriting the equation above in that way,
we find now the prefector in front of--
I mean here, what you have is the time
derivative is given by the difference of steady state,
and this is the relaxation coefficient.
And the relaxation coefficient is--
that's the solution.
You just have to do the substitutions yourself.
The relaxation coefficient, how population
relates to steady state is now given
by the sum of the two rates.
One is going from the upper to the lower,
and from the lower to the upper state, and each of those rates
has been expressed by sine squared and cosine squared.
OK, I'm not doing it here because it's a little bit more
complicated, but you can also rewrite for the dressed atom
picture what happens--
you can rewrite those equations in a way what
happens not to the population, but what
happens to the coherences, to the off-diagram matrix
element formulated in the dressed state basis.
And what you find is, you find a correlation time, a relaxation
time for the coherences.
Remember, for the naked state, populations relaxed with gamma.
Coherences relaxed with gamma over 2.
This is where the optical Bloch equations.
But now we have formulated the physics in the dressed atom
picture.
And what the solution is is the following.
This is sort of weak laser power,
but, in the most general case, what you find
is that the width of the central peak
reflects the relaxation time for the population,
and the width for this is the relaxation time
for the coherences in the dressed atom picture.
So we had, before, with the optical block equations,
I showed you different cases.
We had a three quarter gamma.
I need two more minutes, and I'm finished with my unit.
So we had to weird factors of three quarters,
and I showed you how they come from the eigenvalues
of the matrix of the optical Bloch equation.
But now we understand them physically,
namely, the center feature has a peak
which is the relaxation time for the populations
in the dressed atom picture.
And the side bands have a width, which is the relaxation
time for the coherencies.
And they no longer differ by a factor of two
as in the naked bases in which we formulated the Optical Bloch
Equations.
By the way, I know a lot of you may be curious
about the coherent peak.
You can read about it in API.
It's 10 pages about correlation function.
But, in the end, the weight of the delta function
can be, again, described by values we have just calculated.
We've just calculated steady state populations
and transition rates, so this weight
is nothing else than another combination of sine squares
and cosine squares of this angle theta.
So everything is wonderfully and simply described,
the full physics of that, by just this inner theta
