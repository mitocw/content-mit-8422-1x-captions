So the Gross- Piteavskii equation
was invented in 1962, about 50 years ago
by Gross and Piteavskii to describe vertices.
Actually, Lev Piteavskii is still alive,
going strong, and publishing papers.
One of his latest predictions was solitons in Fermic gases.
And I know in professor [INAUDIBLE] group, some--
one of his labs just looked at the same physics
and compared to theory of Lev Piteavskii.
And this year we are celebrating--
I forgot the 85th or 90th birthday of him.
Huh?
90?
I know there's a poster next to my door,
but I forgot the-- which anniversary.
So I mean, he's a legend, but he's still walking.
He's still doing science.
So if you meet him, you go back to 50 years in history.
Anyway, it is this Lev Pitaevskii
and he invented his equations to describe vortices.
So anyway, so we have this non-linear Schrodinger
equation.
Let me just show you what vortices are
and how they are formed.
Vortices come if you solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation
or if you have ever any quantum fluid or quantum gas
and you add angular momentum.
The angular momentum cannot lead to the rigid body rotation.
This would violate the fact that the velocity field has
to be equitational to make sure that the phase of the wave
function is well defined.
So if you rotate the system, it can
it can absorb angular momentum only by forming vortices.
And vortices are singular points of the wave function,
singular points where the density is zero.
In other words, I don't have time to give full--
to be exhaustive here.
But when something rotates, there is a dynamic phase.
You can say because there are meta-waves going in circles.
And the integral of the phase has
to be an integer number of two pis, otherwise,
you would not have a well-defined phase
of the wave function.
And if you now say you make a circle which is 2pi.
You make the circle smaller, smaller, smaller.
In the middle of the circle, you go around the wave function
changes by 2 pi.
But what should the wave function do on one point?
Should it reach number between zero
and 2pi should the function peak.
Well the wave function says, I can't peak.
I just go to zero.
And a zero value has no phase and I'm fine.
That's expected what the wave function tells you.
So therefore, if you want to describe vorticies,
you want to know describe the Gross-Pitaevskii equation,
but with the boundary condition that the wave function
goes to zero.
And if you want to describe one vortex,
you want the wave function to go zero
in the center of the cloud.
And so you make a corresponding ansatz.
You allow the phase wrap around by 2pi
when the angle phi is varied.
And then when you solve it, you have, of course,
put in that there should be a zero
of the density at the center.
And it's now-- nice for me to--
there's an important review paper which
describes all that and more.
But it's nice to show you now two extreme cases
of the ideal condensate without interaction
and strongly interacting condensate.
The ideal condensate well--
we are in the first excited state of the harmonic
oscillator potential.
And this is the dashed line.
And of course, the size of the whole, the zero
is pretty much on the order of oscillator length,
because there is no other length scale in an ideal harmonic
oscillator.
But if you have the interacting system,
remember what interactions are doing.
They want to keep the density as constant as possible.
Well we are not in a box potential.
We are in an inverted parabola potential.
And remember our Thomas-Fermi solution, which
neglects kinetic energy, is the inverted parabola up to here.
And then the tail is when we can no longer
neglect the kinetic energy.
But if you now say, OK fine, but now, in addition,
we want a vortex in the center.
The wave function out there says, no, we
do what minimizes kinetic energy and what
minimizes repulsive energy.
We follow the inverted parabola and only
at the very last moment on the scale of the healing length
the system meets the required boundary conditions
that the density goes to zero.
Anyway with this qualitative understanding,
you can get a lot out of those.
You can immediately understand the salient feature
of the solution.

Tim.
I know we are not talking details,
but is there a simple, maybe clear reason
why when spin a Bose-Einstein condensate
you get many vortices, but when you
spin like your coffee in your cup you just get one big one.
Yes.

OK.
So the question is if I have a wrap around of four pi in phase
whether this--
whether the system should have a doubly charged vortex
or to similarly charge vortices.
What is the difference in energy?
Well, what happens is doubly charged vortices are unstable.
My group, at some point, were the first to create
doubly charged vortices but we saw
that they immediately decayed.
Pardon?

Initially, we couldn't observe it.
We just saw that it was unstable,
but it's a decay into two vortices.
But it's easy to understand.
If you put two vortices on top of each other,
what is the energy of the system compared to one vortex.
Well, the energy of a vortex is the rotational field around it.
And if you superimpose two vortices,
the velocity around the doubly charged vortices
is twice the velocity of one vortex.
And therefore, the kinetic energy is four times.
If you have two vortices which are far separated that it has
its own velocity field, it has its own velocity field here,
and when the true velocity fields come together,
the velocity is already so low that you
don't have to consider that.
Then those two vortices have an energy,
which is two times the energy of a single vortex.
So therefore when the two vortices,
they start out with four times the energy of a single vortex,
and when they dissociate and repel each other,
they have shedded half of their energy.
So this argument tells you immediately
that vortices are in effect repulsive.
And therefore, any multiple charged vortex
will spontaneously decay.
It's also this net repulsion between vortices
which makes a vortices arrange in a regular lattice.
The regular lattice, which you saw before,
is nature's answer to how can we minimize the energy of all
those vortices.
And the idea is let's keep the average distance between them
as large as possible and the answer is a hexagonal lattice.
Matt.
So a few slides back you plotted the, sort of--
when you write the GP equation and you plotted, sort of,
for the--
in a box potential the ground state
and the first excited state, sort of,
comparing the GP equation to the typical single particle
solution.
And so I guess I'm a little bit confused about how,
sort of, excitations manifest themselves in the system.
Because in some sense, like if you were to solve the GP
equation, then would you arrive at
say like a spectrum of solutions?

I guess I'd be confused at whether the excitations
manifest themselves into that spectrum of solutions.
Or rather then, they become excitations that like
are, sort of, deviations from the mean field as,
you know, including the extra.
Matt, you are now asking about something more complicated.
You're asking what are the excited states of the many body
system.
And actually we have already found one answer
and this is if you want this small excitations,
it's one particle becomes of phonon
or one particle becomes a quasi-particle.
What we are talking about here is
what happens if they whole macroscopic wave function
is in an excited state.
So we are asking here in the box potential, what
happens if we force all n atoms to have one node in the wave
function.
And this is what I'm talking about here.
So the excitation energy of this state
here is much, much higher than of single quasi-particle
excitations.
I'm not sure if I'm addressing your question here, but--
So when single particle-- single quasi-particle excitations,
are those essentially sort of deviations from the mean field?
There is, you know--
No.
They are-- you really look for many body physics--

mean field deviations-- probably what, I mean,
what you do is the Bogoliu--

in that sense, yes, you are allowing
in this ansatz the psi operator is
psi average plus fluctuations.
You now look for fluctuations.
And you are looking for the energy ion
spectrum of those fluctuations.
And the answer are quasi-particles.
So it's actually the Bogoliubov solution
for the spectrum of the fluctuations.
And the answer is the dispersion relation I will send it to you.
Whereas here, we are asking what are
excited states of the macroscopic wave function.
It's a very, very different question,
which we have addressed here.
Colin.
So when you stir the condensate, do you
view it as-- do you stir at the track frequency?
So I do, sort of, N single excitations
or do you stir at N times the track frequencies.
So you do one, sort of, N particle excitation.
The experimental answer is you want
to stir at the quadrupole frequency, which is square root
two times the trap frequency.
Then you create quatrupolar excitations.
The quatrupolar excitation can be regarded as a standing sound
wave, but you create a macroscopic number
of those excitations.
So you make actually the whole condensate wave function
oscillate in a quadrupolar pattern,
but it's a rotating quadrupole.
And that eventually then rearranges itself
and leads to vortices.
So I think the correct answer is the most efficient way
to create vortices would be to excite quasi-particles,
but then excite so many, and this
may relate to Matt's question, create so many quasi-particles
that you have really a time dependent
and oscillating macroscopic wave function.

So eventually you have a coherent excitation
of quasi-particles and that eventually
means the condensate moves in a quadrupolar pattern,
but it's a quadrupolar pattern with rotation
and that eventually turns into many vortices.
