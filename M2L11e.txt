We had focused before on the force between two atoms.
And if we use a microscopic model for the metal plates,
it should be--
it must be-- possible to obtain the Casimir
potential by just summing up all the forces between atoms.
Because ultimately, if you have no metal plates,
you don't have any force.

Whereas in the last few minutes, we
focused on a derivation which was simply summing up
the zero-point energies.
And there are two papers, which I've posted,
which argue that both results are equivalent.
So I would really recommend to you--
he expresses it much better than I can--
read the introduction, the conclusion from Jaffe's paper.
He clearly says in the introduction
that there are a lot of books and references by famous people
who have said the Casimir force is the manifestation
of the zero-point in action.
The fact that people have observed the Casimir force
means that h bar omega over 2 is real.

Those authors take the opposite approach.
They say, this is just heuristic.
It's convenient.
You can get the correct result.
But there is an equivalent derivation
which gives exactly the same result, which focuses only
on pairwise interactions between atoms.
And it does not make any reference
to the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic field.
So therefore, I would agree with those authors that
the conclusion is there is absolutely no observational
evidence for the zero-point energy--
that the zero-point energy is not just convenient counting,
but that it is a real energy.
And the Casimir force--
of course also, it has often been
quoted as an counter example that this
is a direct observation--
should not be regarded as such.
Now people at MIT probably know Bob Jaffe.
He is a high-energy physicist.
And why is he interested in atomic physics?
Why is he interested in the Casimir force?
Well, the question of zero point energies
is very, very important in these days for dark energy.
You know that 80% of the energy of the universe is dark energy.
Then there is dark matter, and then there is baryonic matter.
But this dark energy is really mysterious.
And one candidate for dark energy
is the dark energy simply comes from the zero point energy.
So therefore, people are now really
interested is the dark energy real?
And if it is real, does it have a gravitational effect?
Does it change the metric of space?
And can it accelerate the expansion of the universe?
So of course, you have a problem.
If you calculate the zero-point energy,
you don't introduce a cutoff.
You have a spectacular UV divergence.
You can maybe now truncate the divergence
by saying, OK, eventually, if the wavelengths become
shorter and shorter and shorter, there is a cutoff.
And if you have no idea at all, you
would introduce the cutoff at the Planck length,
because beyond the Planck length,
all physical descriptions break down.
But if you cut it off at the Planck length,
you'll find that the zero-point energy of all modes
is larger than the observed dark energy in the universe
through acceleration of the cosmic expansion
by 124 orders of magnitude.
And if you think you want to introduce a cutoff which is
maybe the classical electron radius--
the classical electron radius is the radius
of a charged sphere for which the electrostatic energy would
just be the rest energy of the electron--
well, then you're off by 43 orders of magnitude.
So some people have called those discrepancies,
which are completely unresolved as of now, the biggest failure
every of theoretical physics.
So anyway, that's why there is renewed interest in the Casimir
force.
And at least in electromagnetics,
we have a very, very simple model,
and we have experiments which measure the Casimir force.
But as I've said, it cannot be regarded as a direct
observation of the zero-point energy.

OK, let me now come to the question
we started discussing earlier, namely, here we have atoms.
Here we have a metalized boundary condition.
So maybe let's just talk for one minute about it.
What kind of assumptions do we make about atoms
when we replace them by a metallic boundary condition?

From the whole derivation of the Casimir force,
it's not obvious that there are no atomic properties which
have entered the calculation of the Casimir potential.
But Bob Jaffe argues in this paper--
and again, it's wonderful reading.
I really recommend, just if you want to enjoy some physics,
open up the document and read the first and the last page.
The Casimir force, from an idealized boundary condition,
is completely independent of atomic properties.
So therefore, it must be a limit where--
well, we talked about the resonant wavelengths,
but we can also talk about the fine structure constant.
Because the fine structure constant in a hydrogenic model
provides what the resonant conditions in hydrogen are.
So you can argue if something is completely
independent of atomic properties,
somehow, by sweeping things under the rug,
we must have set alpha to either 0 or infinite.
Because if it is set to any value,
it would correspond to some version of the hydrogen atom,
which has a resonant radiation.
So the question is, is alpha set to 0?
Is alpha set to infinity when you derive the Casimir force?
And I think this is now easy to discuss,
because the fine structure constant, alpha,
is e squared over h plus e.
If you set alpha to 0, you do it by setting
the charge of the atoms to 0, and then you
have no interaction at all.
So therefore, if you want to have the Casimir
force in a limit which is independent
of atomic properties, the alpha equals 0 limit gives no force.
So therefore, the equivalence between this picture
summing up over real atoms and obtaining the Casimir force
for the metallic boundary condition,
this equivalence happens when you do this derivation
and set the fine structure constant to infinity.

How big is the fine structure constant?
1 over 137.
So it's actually, in some expansions
of alpha and alpha squared, it's actually a small parameter.
And now I'm telling you, when you have two metal plates
and measure the Casimir force, this
corresponds to the infinite alpha limit.
Well, this is now getting complicated.
And I can refer here only to Bob Jaffe's paper.
But he shows that when you go to distances of 0.5 micron,
where people have measured the Casimir force,
you are already in the alpha equals infinity limit
if alpha is larger than 10 to the minus 5.
So therefore, alpha equals 1 over 137 is, for that purpose,
already very, very well in the larger alpha limit.
But I just take this result here.
This is rather complicated.
And Bob Jaffe says that to get the Casimir potential
by summing up over atoms is actually a quite challenging
mathematical exercise.
Questions?
Yes.
If this calculations of summing over atoms
has been worked through, then we can just
talk about the plates being dielectrics from that atom
makes [INAUDIBLE], right?
There are solutions for dielectric plates.
And sometimes when people do experiments,
the best surfaces you can get is a silicon surface.
So because they wanted to do quantitative measurements,
they are discussing corrections due to the dielectric constant.
So I know the problem has been worked
out for dielectric surfaces, I assume
not by doing the transition from summing up atom by atom,
but by rather looking at the boundary
condition for electromagnetic fields
in the presence of a dielectric.
But I don't know more details about that.
Yes, [INAUDIBLE]?
[INAUDIBLE] not make sense, then,
[INAUDIBLE] when we consider two plates--
if we remember from two atoms, we've
got the two, 1 over r to the 6, 1
over r to the 7 cases, one of which
is the retarded Casimir potential, but for two plates,
it was, again, we conclude that it was more
like the short range--
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
No, long range, we are always retarded.
OK, but then, I'm a bit confused,
because then if you say alpha goes to infinity,
don't you have h bar or c to 0?
Oh, wait, that makes sense.
Alpha infinity is-- we know that this is
the rest mass of the electron.
The Rydberg constant is alpha squared times smaller.
And the Rydberg constant, well, a quarter
of the Rydberg constant is the Lyman-alpha radiation.
So anyway, the Rydberg constant is the scale factor
in the transition frequencies of the hydrogen atom.
And so therefore, it is consistent
that, if you make alpha large, we actually
push the frequency of the atomic transition
to very, very high frequencies.
And that would mean the resonant wavelength goes to 0.
And therefore, any finite distance
between the capacitor plate in the long range,
is longer than the wavelength of the transition.
I think equivalently, you could also say if the speed of light
is really slow, you always will have Rydberg--
You can do the transition in many ways,
by tuning the speed of light or tuning the charge.
But it all has the same implication.
Other questions?
Nancy.
Is there any other observable reason
why we should constantly be thinking about Casimir
whose [INAUDIBLE] dark energy?

As far as I know, this question about dark energy
and whether it is related or not to zero-point energy
of the field is completely open.
I think if you had an idea how to do a decisive-- if any
of you had an idea how to make a decisive experiment measuring
whether zero-point energies are real or not,
that would have a big impact.
As far as I know, it's completely open.
Nobody has a really good idea.

So some people feel mathematically,
the zero-point energy has the right,
correct physical characteristics.
Zero-point energy could explain the extra term
in Einstein's field equation, which is often called
the cosmological constant term.
But the quantity is so many orders of magnitude
off that people don't even know if that is correct or not.
One could also say, well, maybe zero-point energies
do not give rise at all to any cavitation potential.
And therefore, maybe if energy doesn't give rise
to gravitational potential, maybe the energy is not real.
And what is responsible for the expansion of the universe
is just the cosmological constant,
but the cosmological constants reflects something else
in the universe, and it's not related at all
to zero-point energy.
To the best of my knowledge, these are the possibilities.
