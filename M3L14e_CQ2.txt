Question.
How would you give a simple answer if I would ask you
what about energy conservation?
I was hammering so much on energy conservation.
How can we conserve energy by having a laser photon
and emitting one at a different frequency?
Compensate [INAUDIBLE]
It's compensated with it.
And now let me ask you another question.
If you would scatter N photons and you do an experiment,
you would expect that due to poor sound
fluctuation and such--
we've talked about fluctuations of intensity
and squeezed light and all that--
but unless you do something special
you would expect if you excite an atom it emits N photons.
In your experiment you measure plus minus square root
and you measure Poissonian statistics.
What would you actually expect?
But now let's expect you observe N plus photons
on the upper side bent.
What would you-- and you measure and you
observe in minus photons on the lower side bent.
Would you expect that in plus and minus, both
have now Poissonian fluctuations or would
you expect something else?

In other words, let me be very specific.
If you count plus--

or we can make it a clicker question--
so you have a counting experiment.
And you have N plus photons in the upper side bent and N
minus in the lower side bent.
And if you simply look at the variance, which
is the square of the standard deviation form N plus,
you'll find that it's Poissonian is secluded.

So the question which I have now is
what is the variance between N plus minus N minus?
Is it simply the variance of N plus plus the variance
of n minus?
The second answer I want to give you is 0.
And the third answer is something else.
So this is A, this is B, and this is C.
