The next question is now we do exactly the same thing,
but now we have the two currents.
And the question is, what is the variance in iPlus?
I add the two currents.
What do I get?

And I give you the same choices as before.
Just as a reminder, when we did not squeeze,
the variance was in.
So the question is now has the squeezing done nothing,
or has it reduced the variance?
