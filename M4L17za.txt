We've discussed dipole traps, different ways how
we can understand why there is a dipole potential
from the harmonic oscillator, to the [INAUDIBLE] atom,
to the refraction of light by small spheres.
So in all cases, we realize that red-detuned light traps.
Today I want to discuss what is at work here,
electrical magnetic forces.
And then I want to address what several of you
have ask, where is energy conservation.
