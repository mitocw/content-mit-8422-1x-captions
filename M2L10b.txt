So the subject that we want to understand-- interactions
between neutral objects.

So let's start in a very basic way by saying we
have an atom a, we have an atom b,
they are separated by a distance R, and we want to know
what is the force between them.
In a semi-classical picture, we would
say that the force which is responsible for that
must be the Coulomb force.
So the atom a and b consists of charges.
So we should find the charge density in our system
a, the charge density of b, we take the Coulomb energy,
and we integrate over the volume.
And this is how in E&M in the most general way
you would write down electrostatic energy
of a system.
You take all charges.
Each charge has a Coulomb potential with the other charge
and you sum and integrate over everything.
But for objects which are localized,
we can do multiple expansion.
Our objects are neutral atoms so therefore, there
is no Coulomb term and the next term is the dipole.
So therefore, starting with classical physics,
we would find that the interaction of those
charge density distributions--
one for atom a, one for atom b-- should actually
interact with this Hamiltonian h prime.

But now, if we look at it classically,
we find that classically, the expectation
value for the dipole operator of each atom is 0.
But you will also find--
if you said, well, OK, that's what I expect,
because an atom is in isotropic space.
How can it have a dipole moment?
But maybe what could happen is if there
is a fluctuation of a dipole moment here
and a fluctuation there and the fluctuations are correlated,
then the two systems may repel or attract each other.
So therefore, when we are talking about fluctuations,
we are talking about expectation values for d-squared.
But also in classical physics, this is exactly 0.
So what classical physics tells us,
it says in classical physics, it costs more energy
to create a dipole moment or even
a fluctuating dipole moment than one
gets back from the dipole interaction.
So the system will never spontaneously form
some form of dipole moment and in classical physics,
two neutral atoms will have no attraction at all.
So it costs more energy.

So now we have to do quantum mechanics.
And as so often, I have to go through a classical argument
to make you wonder about the quantum mechanical result
because the quantum mechanical result, you are used to it.
You've heard about the Van der Waals interaction
but now you know that there is really
something quantum at work.
In quantum mechanics, the expectation value
of the square of the dipole operator is not 0.
You can see that the dipole moment for a charged system
is related between electron and proton
to the displacement operator R. And even
if you have an equilibrium position,
like in an harmonic oscillator where R is equal to 0,
R-squared, the expectation value,
is not 0 because whatever your stable equilibrium is,
you will have zero-point fluctuations around it.
And so therefore, now in quantum physics,
it's not that we have to provide energy to create d-squared.
We have it.
We have it by necessity because of non-commuting operators
because of the nature of quantum physics.
So now the fact that we have fluctuating dipole moments
already, that means if now the fluctuating dipole moments
between the two atoms are synchronized,
this will then lead to a non-vanishing average force
between the atoms.
So that's the idea.
But the good thing is you don't even
have to know about it, about fluctuations and all that.
You just take-- and this is your homework.
You just take the operator h prime
and look what happens when you have an atom in the ground
and excited state and what happens when you force
atoms in the ground state.
In the first case, you get the leading result
in first-order operation theory.
For two ground-state atoms, you have to go to second order.
In first order, the potential is 1 over R-cubed.
And you will calculate the c3 coefficient.
In second order, you get the Van der Waals potential,
which is 1 over R to the 6.
And it's fairly straightforward to calculate
the c6 coefficient.
Any questions?
Let me re-emphasize the beauty of this operation result
is it's so simple but the downside
is you don't really understand what you are doing.
You are solving an equation, you find an expectation value,
but the nature of the effect--
how it is related to fluctuation,
what is really behind it--
